00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,093
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:05,078
We know that most of you still working really hard on the last couple of assignments and problem sets

3
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:12,035
but nevertheless our NLP class is coming to its close and so we thought we’ll both update you on a few of the issues.

4
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:15,004
And first of all, everyone is always interested in numbers

5
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,029
so let’s say a bit about the numbers.

6
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:24,044
So, it seems like, as we come into week 7’s material of the problem sets and programming assignments,

7
00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:28,041
it seems like there are about 5,000 people still actively watching the videos

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:32,042
and about 2,000 people doing all the work of the homeworks.

9
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:37,018
But that’s, you know, overall has just been enormous amount of stuff going on

10
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:40,062
so it now have well over a million video views and all.

11
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:43,018
Yeah, it’s very exciting.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,046
Programming homework six, the parsing homework, was definitely our hardest homework so far

13
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,046
and there were definitely problems with the code being under-commented

14
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:56,067
so we appreciate very much those of you who helped out each other in the forums and made things very clear for each other.

15
00:00:56,067 --> 00:01:01,020
Those of you who managed to finish the homework have told they got a lot out of it.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,036
But those of you who didn’t have the time to do all of it,

17
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:07,031
we encourage you to do come back and do programming homework seven and eight

18
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:11,017
which are much easier than homework six and should be a lot fun as well.

19
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:14,052
One of the things that some people have been asking about is,

20
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:18,083
“Hey, can we take those great parsers that we did write for programming assignment six

21
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:23,076
and keep on working on them by posting them on Github or some other site like that?”

22
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:26,096
There is a slight problem with that because, you know,

23
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:29,094
we are hoping that we’ll be able to do this cause again sometime in the future

24
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:32,027
and we’d like to be able to reuse some of the assignments

25
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:37,072
so I’d really prefer that there just aren’t great solutions to all the assignments sitting on the open web

26
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:41,086
and to keep some of that stuff on the forum sites for the class.

27
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:46,052
So, it’s great that people want to keep exploring and doing better things for NLP

28
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:53,074
but we’d really think it’s probably a better idea for you to pick out one of the several open source NLP frameworks that’re out there

29
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:56,097
and look at ways in which you can contribute to that

30
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:59,036
because that both doesn’t sort of conflict with our assignments

31
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:03,059
but actually going to be more useful for you and people around the world in general

32
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:05,094
if you’re helping along these open source frameworks.

33
00:02:05,094 --> 00:02:09,058
So there are good ones — For Python NLTK is the best-known one;

34
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:13,035
and there are several well-known Java NLP open source frameworks

35
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:16,050
which certainly includes our own Stanford NLP tools

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,063
but also other things like OpenNLP, the GATE NLP Framework;

37
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:24,020
components: UIMA — a bunch of stuff out there if you look around.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:31,060
Okay and that brings up the issue of what’s going to happen with this class website after the class ends.

39
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,080
It is going to stay open and available

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,065
and all you guys will be able to keep on looking at stuff and referencing things

41
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:43,002
and even beyond that, what we’re also going to have is this going to be available in an archive mode.

42
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:46,015
So, people who haven’t been registered in the class

43
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:50,022
will also be able to look at the content in terms of the videos that are up there

44
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:56,002
but not the programming assignments which we are kind of going to keep to the people who were enrolled in the class.

45
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:58,038
But you shouldn’t worry about things going away.

46
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,041
Yes and those of you who are enrolled can still —

47
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,041
the forums will stay up —

48
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,037
we encourage you to continue to talk to each other on the forums.

49
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:07,081
Those of you who never got to finish some of the homeworks,

50
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:09,031
keep working on the homeworks,

51
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:12,002
go ahead and post them the site will stay up and then.

52
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:16,005
For new people we will eventually be teaching the class again

53
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:18,029
but meanwhile we’ll be leaving the videos up

54
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:21,006
so if your friends want to watch the videos, we encourage that.

55
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,062
And then eventually we’ll actually teach the class again.

56
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:32,023
In fact for everybody that’s been really helpful on the forums that,

57
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:33,086
we mentioned this earlier about helping people out with the code,

58
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:36,015
helping people out with basic NLP.

59
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,096
It’s been very supportive community and we really appreciate that and we think it’s really great.

60
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:42,080
We’d like help from you in suggesting —

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,098
you have already given us suggestions for next year but I’ve put up a forum just now

62
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:52,043
that we’d like you to give us specific suggestions about ways we can make the course better for next year.

63
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,090
We know Homework six is one of them

64
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:00,084
but there’s lot of suggestions you’ve given about improving the problem sets or other reading material we can suggest

65
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:03,055
or anything else that will help us improve our course for the second time we teach it

66
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:05,074
that would be great.

67
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:12,086
We all have dreams of the future where there are computers with full natural language understanding

68
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:16,047
and in our research we still variously hoped to work to those goals

69
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:21,099
but in terms of the practical NLP that’s applied around the world at the moment,

70
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:25,039
really you guys are just seeing the ton of the stuff that are actually used.

71
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:30,058
Things like text classifiers, building sequence classifiers, named entities and other things,

72
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:34,052
parsers, questions answering, machine techniques,…

73
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:37,042
So you really should feel good if you’ve made your way through this class

74
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:41,097
that you are a competent practitioner of the kind of useful NLP techniques

75
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:47,051
that’re leading to a new class of more intelligent language-wielding computer applications

76
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,041
and so we hope that you’ll be able to take these ideas and knowledge

77
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:56,022
and go often apply them in many different places.

78
00:04:56,022 --> 00:05:01,048
We clearly in this world now by human language material is just everywhere over the web

79
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:07,097
as part of the new move to the content authoring and social computing that’s going on everywhere.

80
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:13,008
So much of that is about language use so now you have a good toolkit to be able to go off and do things with that material

81
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:16,001
and we hope that you’ll be able to find good things to do.

82
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:21,015
Yeah. Thanks for taking the class and look forward to seeing you wherever and whenever we see you.

83
00:05:21,015 --> 99:59:59,000
Thanks a lot.
