00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,055
Hi, everyone. You know, that most of you
still working really hard on the last

2
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:08,083
couple of assignments and problem sets but
nevertheless now NOP class is coming to

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:12,085
its close and so we thought we'll both
update you on a few of the issues. And

4
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:17,003
first of all, [inaudible] always interest
in numbers so let's say it's just about

5
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:21,081
the numbers. So, it seems like. As we come
in to week 7's material of the problem

6
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:26,076
that's in programming assignments. It
seems like there are about 5,000 people

7
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:31,072
still actively watching the videos and
about 2,000 people doing all the work at

8
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:36,061
the home works. But that's, you know,
overall has just been enormous amount of

9
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:41,057
stuff going on so it now have well over a
million video views and all. Yeah, it's

10
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:45,078
very exciting. For homework six. The
parsing homework was definitely our

11
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:49,083
hardest homework so far and there were
definitely problems with the codes being

12
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:54,013
under commented so we appreciate very much
those of you who helped out each other in

13
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:58,011
the forums and made things very clear for
each other. Those of you who managed to

14
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,064
finish the homework have a lot to pull
this so they got along out of it. But

15
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:05,036
those of you who didn't have the time to,
to do all of it. We encourage you to do

16
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:09,012
come back and do put them in homework
seven and eight which are much easier than

17
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:13,003
homework six and should be a lot fun as
well. One of the things that some people

18
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:17,016
have been asking about is, hey, can we
take those great passes that we did write

19
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:21,024
for [inaudible] assignment six and keep on
working on them by posting them on

20
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:25,031
[inaudible] or some of the site like that.
There is a slight problem with that

21
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:29,033
because, you know, we are hoping that
we're gonna do this cause again sometime

22
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:33,046
in the future and we'd like to be have to
reuse some of the assignments so I'd

23
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:38,001
really prefer that they're just that great
solutions to all the assignments sitting

24
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:42,019
on the open web and to keep some of that
stuff on the forum sites for the class.

25
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:47,009
So, it's great that people. Want to keep
exploring and doing better things for NOP

26
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:51,057
but. We really think this probably a be
tter idea for you to pick out one of the

27
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:55,087
several open source NLP frameworks that
out there and look at ways in which you

28
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:59,090
can contribute to that because that both
doesn't sort of conflict with our

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,031
assignments but actually gonna be more
useful for you and people around the world

30
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:08,072
in general if you're helping along these
open source frameworks. So there are good

31
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:12,096
ones, the Python and LTK is the best known
one and there are several well-known,

32
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,021
Java, NLP Open Source Frameworks which
certainly includes our own stand for NLP

33
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:21,078
tools but also other things like Open NLP,
the Gate NLP Framework. [inaudible] I'll

34
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:27,083
just [inaudible] out there [inaudible]
out. Okay and that. Rings up the issue of

35
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:32,010
all, what's gonna happen with this class
website after the class ends. It is gonna

36
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,043
stay open and available and all you guys
will be have to keep on looking at stuff

37
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:40,060
and referencing things and even beyond
that, what we're also gonna have is this

38
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,082
gonna be available in the Archive Mode.
So, people who haven't been registered in

39
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:49,015
the class, you also have to look at the
content in terms of the videos that are up

40
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:53,047
there and they are not program and the
assignments which were entertainment gonna

41
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:57,086
keep to the people who were enrolled in
the class. But you shouldn't worry about

42
00:02:57,086 --> 00:03:01,081
things going away. Yes and those of you
who are enrolled, can still, the formal

43
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:05,093
stay up, we encourage you to continue to
talk to each other in the forms. Those of

44
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:09,073
you who never got to finish some of the
home works, keep working on the home

45
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:13,086
works, go ahead and post them the site
will stay up and then. For, for new people

46
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:18,004
who will eventually be teaching the class
again but meanwhile we'll be leaving the

47
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:22,002
videos up so if your friends wanna watch
the videos, we encourage that. And then

48
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:28,012
eventually we'll actually teach the class
again. In fact for. Everybody has been

49
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:31,091
really helpful on the forums that, we
mentioned this earlier about helping

50
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:35,095
people out with, with the code, helping
people out with basic NLP. It's been very

51
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:39,084
supportive community and we really
appreciate that and we think it's really

52
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:43,057
great. We'd like help from you in
suggesting, you have already given us

53
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:47,092
suggestions for next year but I put up a,
a forum just now that we'd like you give

54
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:52,012
us specific suggestions about ways we can
make the course better for next year. We

55
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:56,006
know Homework six is one of them but
there's lot of suggestions you've given.

56
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:00,049
About improving the problem sets or other
reading material we can suggest or

57
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,092
anything else that will help us improve
our course for the second time we teach it

58
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:10,078
that would be great. We all have dreams of
the future where there are computers with

59
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:15,064
full natural language understanding in and
our research we still variously hoped to

60
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:20,015
work to those goals but in terms of the
practical NLP does applies around the

61
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:24,089
world at the moment, really you guys are
just seeing the ton of the stuff that you

62
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:28,036
actually used. Things like fix
classifiers, building sequence

63
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:32,099
classifiers, [inaudible] and other things,
parsers questions answering, machine

64
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:37,079
techniques. So, really should feel good if
you made your way through this class that

65
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,088
you confident practitioner of the kind of
[inaudible]. Techniques, the leading to a

66
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:47,096
new cost of more intelligent language
wielding computer applications and so we

67
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:53,017
hope that you'll be able to take these
ideas and knowledge and they'll often. And

68
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:58,026
go often apply them in many different
places including this world now by human

69
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:03,064
language material is just everywhere over
the web as part of the new move to the. >>

70
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:07,060
Content authoring and social computing
that's going on everywhere. So much of

71
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,091
that is about language use so now you have
a good tool kit to be able to go off and

72
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:16,023
do things with that material and we hope
that you'll be able to find good things to

73
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:20,044
do. >> Yeah. Thanks for taking the class
and look forward to seeing you wherever

74
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:23,012
and whenever we see you. Thanks a lot.
