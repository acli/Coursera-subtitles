1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,045
Okay, so let's have a look at some
applications of Bayesian games now beyond

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:08,073
the conflict example that we had looked at
before. And one of the areas that

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,012
understanding in incomplete information
games has made a huge impact as in

4
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:17,046
understanding auctions and incentives to
bid an auction. So let's have a look.

5
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:22,019
We'll start with a very simple version of
auction and then we will actually look at

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,070
some more complicated versions of auctions
and more realistic versions as we go

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,061
along. Let's start with a simple version.
So we have two bidders. They're bidding

8
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:38,035
for painting and we'll look at what's
known as a first price auction and we'll

9
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:45,087
think of a sealed bid auction okay so they
each in this case have a value for the

10
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:51,093
painting so the type of the players is
Theta I. And it, it just specifies how

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:56,038
much they're willing to pay for the
painting. How much do they value the

12
00:00:56,038 --> 00:01:01,032
painting? So, let's, keep things simple.
Let's suppose that they have a value of

13
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:06,002
either two or three, say, dollars or
thousands or millions, what-, whatever you

14
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:10,048
like. So they either value the, the
painting at two or three. And, equal

15
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:14,080
likelihood. So there's a half a
probability that they wake up, and they

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,025
think the painting's worth two. Half a
probability that they wake up, the

17
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:24,067
painting's worth. Three, and we'll think
of this as IID. So, if I wake up, and I

18
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:30,038
think the painting's worth two, the chance
that the other proba-, the other person

19
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:35,087
thinks it's worth two or three is an even
coin flip. So what I end thinking is

20
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:41,065
completely independent of whatever they
like. How much they like the painting. So

21
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:47,008
our tastes are completely [inaudible] wake
up, we decide how much we like the

22
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,043
painting. And now we have to put a bid in
an envelope, and send it off to the

23
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:58,016
seller. So, first price auction. What does
that mean? First price means the highest

24
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,047
bidder wins and they pay their bids, so
first highest price is the winner and pays

25
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:10,006
that particular bid. Okay, so, let's think
of a game now. We got a basing game. We

26
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:16,009
know what the types are. There are either
two or three with equal prob ability, the

27
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:22,000
players have to bid in whole integers, and
in this case in terms of specifying

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,040
payoffs it's quite simple what you pay off
its how much you value the painting minus

29
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:35,014
how you pay so if you win the option
you're going to get Theta I. Minus your

30
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:42,097
bid. If you lose you get zero right so the
payoffs are going to depend on what the

31
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:50,052
actions are which will determine first of
all if you end up having the highest bid

32
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:56,055
or not and what you get is. If you win,
you get your, your, your value minus how

33
00:02:56,055 --> 00:03:01,048
much you bid. If you lose, you just get
zero. Okay? So this is a fully symmetric

34
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:06,041
world. So let's keep our life simple, and
look for a symmetric equilibrium. And

35
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:11,046
we'll look for one in pure strategies. So
what we need to do is specify, so in a

36
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:16,023
symmetric equilibrium, we. Have each
player just we need to specify what they

37
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:21,044
would do if they had a value of three what
they would do if they had a value of two

38
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:26,040
and so that no player would chose to
change their bid if they were both bidding

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,073
that way so they're both happy maximizing
their payoff, expected payoff. Given these

40
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:38,079
bids, if this was the situation. ... >>
Well, let me just say a, a couple of words

41
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,089
about, you know, looking for equilibria,
searching for equilibria in these kinds of

42
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:48,043
games, symmetric, asymmetric, and so
forth. So, you know, th-, there's no easy

43
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:53,035
recipe for always finding equilibria. So,
in worse case scenario is when you're

44
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:57,096
faced with games you might have to just
actually, you know, exhaustively look

45
00:03:57,096 --> 00:04:02,020
through what are all the possible
combinations of strategies that are

46
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,003
possible. And, and solve and find out
which ones are equilibria. Some. You know

47
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:11,077
it's, it's, it's [inaudible]. A little bit
of an art in the sense that there are

48
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:16,074
things that we know about the structure of
the games that give us hints as to how to

49
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:20,089
proceed. And here we have a fully
symmetric setting. And fully symmetric

50
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,015
settings generally though exist a
symmetric equilibrium at least when in

51
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:29,071
mixed strategies and sometimes in pure
strategies so that's a useful starting

52
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:34,056
point. And then we can go through and use
some logic to try and thin the field down

53
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:39,017
in terms of what we might be looking for.
So it's a little bit like looking for

54
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:44,005
solutions to differential equations. There
are different rules. Of thumb. There's

55
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:50,030
structure which helps you guess, how to
proceed, but largely there's no easy and.

56
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,019
Set and however them, they're always going
to find you know, equilibrium easily for

57
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,091
you. Sometimes you gonna have to struggle
a lil bit and, and search through. But

58
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:04,064
here we have a nice simple setting. It's a
symmetric setting. That gives us an idea

59
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:09,019
of what, how to proceed. So, we look for
symmetric equilibrium, and basically what

60
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:13,062
we've to do is specify what should a
person do and they're whenever value of

61
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:19,098
three what, how should they verify a value
of two. Okay. So first of all, one thing

62
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:24,093
to note, so we, again, they, they have to
bid whole integers we can try various

63
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:29,088
combinations. So you, you never want to
bid more than your value, because then if

64
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:34,077
you end up winning, you're paying more
than you value the, the object at. You're

65
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:39,071
going to be getting negative payouts.
You're better off just not bidding at all

66
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,031
or bidding zero. So you, the second bid
that we might. You'll consider is what if

67
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:50,058
you bid your actual value so if I have a
value of three and I bid three then my

68
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:55,085
payoff is zero no matter what so if I lose
I get a payoff of zero if I win I am

69
00:05:55,085 --> 00:06:01,038
paying Theta I minus my bid right so if I
win if I am bidding my value I'm going to

70
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,098
get zero. If these two things are equal,
so in, in, in that case, my pay-off is

71
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:10,066
zero no matter what. So basically in, in a
first-price auction, it's going to be in,

72
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:15,022
in players' interests to shade their bids.
What does that mean? To, to bid less than

73
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:19,073
their value in hopes that, when they win
the object, they're paying less than they

74
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:24,001
value it at, and they're getting some pay,
positive pay-offs, okay? So, a natural

75
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:28,041
thing to try is that they're gonna bid,
when their value is three, they're going

76
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:33,019
to bid something less than three, with, in
hopes of winning some pay-off. And, when

77
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:38,006
their value i s two, they're going to bid
less than. Too. So we can start by looking

78
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:43,039
for an equilibrium of that form. Well,
that's an easy one to try. Let's try

79
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,083
bidding one below your value, in this case
we'll bid when your values three bid two,

80
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:56,012
when your value is two bid one. So let's
check. We just want to check if this is a

81
00:06:56,012 --> 00:07:02,010
symmetric equilibrium. So if the other
player is bidding according to this, if

82
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:08,062
theta I is three and the other player uses
this strategy, what's my expected utility?

83
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:14,016
Well, if I build three. I'm getting, we,
we already just went through this. I, I'm

84
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:19,052
always gonna get zero. So win or lose no
matter what I'm gonna get a payoff of

85
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:24,081
zero. If I lose I get zero. If I, if I win
I'm bidding my full value, I get nothing

86
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:29,097
out of it so that gives me a payoff of
zero. If I bid two, what happens? Well,

87
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:35,099
when I do win. I'm going to get my value
of three. The price I pay is two. So this

88
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:41,044
is the bid. This is my theta I, so my
value is, is three minus two. What's the

89
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:46,067
probability that I win? Well the
probability, there's a 50, 50 chance that

90
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:52,055
the other person is a low type or a high
type. If their bidding according to this

91
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:58,093
function there's a half a probability that
their going to bid. One and a half a

92
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:05,070
probability that they did two. So if I'm
bidding two there's one half probability

93
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:12,014
that I win outright. And there's a half a
chance that we tie. And if we tie, we have

94
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:17,006
the seller just flip a coin, and decide
randomly who wins. So there's a half a

95
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:22,005
chance that we tie, and then a half a
chance that I win the coin flip. So I end

96
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:26,098
up winning with a probability a quarter.
So what's my overall value from this?

97
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:32,062
Three quarters. What would happen if I bid
one instead? Well, if I bid one instead I

98
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:38,002
get a higher value here so when I do win,
I'd end up with paying less. That's great.

99
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:43,061
I get the painting for less but the chance
that I win is now only when I match, so if

100
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm bidding one the only time I'm gonna
win is when the other person bids one and

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,050
I win the coin flick. So there's a half a
chance that the other person bids one, and

102
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,068
half a chance t hat they win the coin
flip. Overall probability of a quarter. So

103
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:04,086
here, 3-1-2, a quarter. We end up with a
value of one-half. So here, you know, I

104
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:10,004
end up, I'm better off bidding two than
bidding one. And if I bid zero, well, I'm

105
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:15,029
never gonna win. The other person's always
bidding above zero. I get a payoff of

106
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:20,067
zero. So here, my unique best response, if
the other person is bidding according to

107
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:28,025
this unique best response. One Theta I is
= three is to bid two right so if the

108
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:35,016
other person is bidding two and one in
this manner then indeed when I have a

109
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:42,005
value of three then I do want to bid two
so that holds together okay. So we also

110
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:47,023
need to check that the bid of one when
your type is two is the best response, we

111
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:52,029
can go through there. Well what happens
if, if I bid three, I'm bidding above my

112
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:57,029
value, so I'm going to get, whenever I
win, I get a payoff of minus one and now

113
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,016
I'm outbidding the other player all the
time so I'm going to win for sure. I'm

114
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:08,059
going to get a payoff of minus one. If I
did too well. >> Win or lose, it doesn't

115
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:13,065
matter. I get zero because I'm always
bidding, my full value so even when I win

116
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:18,096
I don't get anything. If I bid zero, I
lose for sure, so the only really bid that

117
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:23,084
makes sense in this case is bidding one.
Here, I get some positive value when I

118
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:28,084
win. I win with probably a quarter, right?
I win when the other type is actually a

119
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:34,015
low type, also bidding one. And then I win
the coin flip. So I end up with the value

120
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:41,045
of a quarter. So here, my unique best
response. Is when Theta I is equal to two

121
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:46,099
to bid one. So indeed we've checked that
if the other player's following these

122
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:51,062
strategies in fact I strictly care to
follow these strategies these are my

123
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:56,082
unique best responses so this is an
equilibrium and. It's a symmetric, pure

124
00:10:56,082 --> 00:11:01,037
strategy Bayesian equilibrium. It's a
strict equilibrium so it's a strong

125
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:06,004
equilibrium and so basically Bayesian
equilibrium has given us an analysis of

126
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:10,042
this game which allows us to make
predictions. In this case the better is

127
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:15,063
the low shade their values. How much lower
than the value t hey bid so that here that

128
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:20,012
when your. Type three, you bid two. When
you're type two, you bid one. This gives

129
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:24,050
us some idea of how things might work in
an auction. We'll take a look at a little

130
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,003
more elaborate example of an auction next.
That'll give us a little more insight into

131
