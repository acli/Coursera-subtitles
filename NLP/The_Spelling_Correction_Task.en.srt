00:00:01,056 --> 00:00:06,075
Today we're gonna talk about spelling
correction. Lots of applications make use

2
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:11,062
of spelling correction. For example, word
processing, almost any modern word

3
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:16,062
processor will take a misspelled word like
component with an A and give you

4
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:22,007
suggestions like component with an E and
automatically replace it for you. Modern

5
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:28,025
search engines will not only flag an
error. So, language spelled without a u,

6
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:34,093
here. But, give you, the results, as if
you had spelled the word correctly. And,

7
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:40,095
modern phones additionally will
automatically find misspelled words. Here,

8
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:47,013
I typed l-a-y-r, and it replaced it
automatically, or suggests a replacement,

9
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:52,025
with late. We can distinguish a number of
separate tasks and spelling correction.

10
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:56,092
One is the detection of the error itself.
And then the correction of the error once

11
00:00:56,092 --> 00:01:01,030
you've found it. And we can think about
different kinds of correction. We might

12
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,001
automatically correct an error if we're
positive that the error that we know the

13
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:10,051
right answer for the error. So H-T-E is a
very common misspelling for the, and so

14
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:14,089
many word processors automatically correct
H-T-E. We might suggest a single

15
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:19,049
correction if we're, there's only one very
likely correction, or we might suggest a

16
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,027
whole list of corrections and let the user
pick from among them. We distinguish two

17
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:30,065
different classes of spelling errors. Non
word errors are errors in which the, what

18
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:37,021
the user types is not a word of English.
So g-r-a-f-f-e a misspelling let's say for

19
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:43,051
giraffe is not a word of English. By
contrast, real word errors. Are errors in

20
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:49,058
which then the resulting. [sound]
Misspelling is actually a word of English

21
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:54,086
and that makes them somewhat harder to
detect. And we can break up real word

22
00:01:54,086 --> 00:02:00,021
errors into ones produced by really
typographical processes. These were meant

23
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:06,013
to type three. And typed [inaudible] let's
say. Or cognitive errors, where the user,

24
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:11,099
meant to type a word like [inaudible] and
instead typed a homophone of a, of the

25
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,036
word, or \u201ct-o-o\u201d instead of
[inaudible] And in both cases what, what's

26
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:22,008
produced is a real word of English, but by
modeling the differences between these

27
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:27,045
kind of errors, we might come up with
better ways of fixing them both. How

28
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:33,052
common are spelling errors? Depends a lot
on the task. So in web queries, spelling

29
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:38,095
errors are extremely common. So
practically one in four words in a web

30
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:44,021
query are likely to be misspelled. But in
web processing tasks on phones it's much

31
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:48,066
harder to get an accurate number. So
there's been a number of studies and most

32
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:53,040
of these studies are done by retyping. You
give the user a passage to type and then

33
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,091
you measure how well they, they type it.
And, of course, that's not quite the same

34
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:02,059
user's naturally writing messages or
typing. Nonetheless If you ask users to

35
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:06,098
retype and you don't let them use the
backspace key, they make about thirteen

36
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:10,080
percent of the words, thirteen percent of
the words are in error. So indicating that

37
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,002
if, that a lot of words. They correct
themselves with the backspace. If you let

38
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:21,021
them correct, now we're trying to
experiment on a, on a p d a style phone

39
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:25,085
site, organizer, they'll correct about
seven percent of the words themselves.

40
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:30,084
They'll still leave about two percent of
the words uncorrected, on the organizer.

41
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:35,096
And, similar numbers on people doing
retyping on a regular keyboard. So, the

42
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:41,026
numbers are about two percent where people
typing. And probably a much higher number

43
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:46,028
for web queries and probably a much higher
number for people texting. Are the kind of

44
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:51,021
spelling, spelling error [inaudible] that
we see. How do we detect non word spelling

45
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:56,002
errors. The traditional way is just to use
a large dictionary. Any word not in the

46
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,059
dictionary is an error. And, the larger
the dictionary, it turns out the better

47
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:04,070
this works. For correcting these non-word
spelling errors, we generate a set of

48
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,062
candidates that's real words that are
similar to the error. And then we pick

49
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:12,085
whichever one is best. And we'll talk
about the noisy-channel probability model

50
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:17,002
of how to do that. And it's also related
to another method called the shortest

51
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:20,094
weighted [inaudible] distance myth. So we
find the words that are not in the

52
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:25,012
dictionary. For each one, we generate a
set of candidates. Those are going to be

53
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:29,014
real words that are similar, we'll talk
about what similar means, to that error

54
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:33,044
and then we'll pick the best one. For real
word spelling errors, the algorithm is

55
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:37,064
quite similar. Again, for each word we
generate a candidate set. But now we do

56
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:41,074
this for every word in a sentence, not
just the words that are not in some

57
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:45,094
dictionary. So real word spelling error
correction, we don't use a dictionary

58
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:50,024
because of course the errors are in a
dictionary. So that wouldn't help. So, for

59
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:54,038
every word, we generate a candidate set.
So we might find candidate words with

60
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,046
similar pronunciations, we might find
candidate words with similar spellings,

61
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:02,075
and depending on the algorithm, exactly.
And it's very important that we're gonna

62
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:07,016
include the word itself, in the candidate
set, because the every word might be a

63
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:11,051
misspelling of some other real word, or it
might be the correct word. In fact, most

64
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:15,059
words are probably correct. So, for each
candidate set of each possible error,

65
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:19,073
we're gonna include the word itself. And
most of the time, in fact, we're gonna

66
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:25,064
pick that. And again, how we pick the
words we might use the noisy channel

67
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:32,024
model. We might use a classifier, we'll
talk about that so we'll discuss the

68
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:38,042
different methods of detecting these
errors and correcting them in the next
