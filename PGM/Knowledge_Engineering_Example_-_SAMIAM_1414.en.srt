1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:02,089
So, now, let’s look at an example in [an] actual network,

2
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:06,018
and try to see what the CPD’s look like,

3
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:07,073
what behavior we get,

4
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,048
and how we might augment the network

5
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:11,023
to include additional things.

6
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:12,080
Now, let me warn you right upfront

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,065
that this is a baby network;

8
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:16,026
it’s not a real network,

9
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:19,062
but it’s compact enough to look at, but

10
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:22,091
still interesting enough to get some non-trivial behaviors.

11
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,059
So, to explore the network,

12
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,085
we’re going to use a system called SAMIAM.

13
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:31,066
It was produced by Adnan Darwiche and his group at UCLA,

14
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,063
and it’s nice

15
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:36,015
because it actually works on all sorts of different platforms,

16
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,091
so it’s usable by pretty much everyone.

17
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,053
So let’s look at a particular problem:

18
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:43,061
Imagine that we’re an insurance company

19
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:44,088
and we’re trying to decide

20
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,043
for a person who comes into the door

21
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:49,000
whether to give them insurance or not.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,074
So the operative aspect of making that decision

23
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:54,036
is how much the policy is going to cost us,

24
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,089
that is, how much we’re going to have to pay

25
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,091
over the course of a year to insure this person.

26
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,028
So there is a variable called Cost.

27
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:06,084
Let’s click on that to see what properties that variable have.

28
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:08,050
And we can see that in this case,

29
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,095
we’ve decided to only give two values to the Cost variable,

30
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:13,077
Low and High.

31
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:16,079
This is clearly a very coarse-grained approximation

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,047
and not one that we will use in practice.

33
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:20,030
In reality we would probably

34
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,013
have this be a continuous variable

35
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,088
whose mean depends on various aspects of the model.

36
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:27,078
But for the purposes of our illustration,

37
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:29,055
we’re going to use this discrete distribution

38
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,027
that only has values Low and High.

39
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:32,064
Okay.

40
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:36,085
So now, let’s build up this network using the technique of

41
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:39,050
“expanding the conversation” that we’ve discussed before.

42
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:44,022
And so what is most important determining factor

43
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:46,074
as to the cost of the insurance company has to pay?

44
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:50,064
Well, probably whether the person has accidents

45
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:51,097
and how severe they are.

46
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:57,000
So here we have a network that has two variables:

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,072
One is Accident and one is Cost.

48
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:02,064
And in this case we decided to select

49
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:05,070
three possible values for the accident variable,

50
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,003
None, Mild, and Severe,

51
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:14,044
and with the probabilities that you see listed.

52
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:17,044
And what you see down below is the Cost variable.

53
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,075
And let’s open the CPD

54
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:24,084
of the Cost variable given the Accident variable.

55
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,094
And we can see that, in this case,

56
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:29,016
we have a conditional probability table

57
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:33,035
of Cost given Accident.

58
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,048
Note that this is actually inverted

59
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:38,054
from the notation that we have used in the class before,

60
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:41,071
because here the conditioning cases are columns,

61
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:44,054
whereas in the examples that we’ve given

62
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:45,075
[they] have been rows.

63
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:49,018
But that’s okay, it’s the same thing, just inverted.

64
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,010
And so we see, for example,

65
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,041
that if the person has no accidents,

66
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,076
the costs are very likely to be very low;

67
00:02:56,076 --> 00:03:01,058
mild accidents incur different distributions over cost;

68
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,017
and severe accidents have

69
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,078
a probability of 0.9 of having high cost

70
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:08,041
and 0.1 of having low cost.

71
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,074
So now, let’s continue extending the conversation

72
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,008
and ask what Accident depends on.

73
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:17,020
And it seems that one of the obvious factors

74
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,040
is whether the person is a good driver or not.

75
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,066
And so we would expect driver quality

76
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,096
to be a parent of Accident.

77
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:25,021
But there is other things

78
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,085
that also affect not just the presence of an accident,

79
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,091
but also the severity of the accident.

80
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:33,090
So for example, vehicle size would affect

81
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,011
both the severity of an accident

82
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,078
because if you are driving a large SUV, then chances are

83
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:43,059
you are not likely to be in an accident as severe

84
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:45,068
but it might also perhaps increase

85
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:47,037
the chance of having an accident overall

86
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:51,083
because maybe driving a large car is harder to handle.

87
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:56,038
And then vehicle year might affect the chances of an accident

88
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:59,050
because of the presence or absence of certain safety features

89
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,003
like anti-lock brakes and airbags.

90
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,081
So let’s open the CPD of Accident

91
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:05,017
and see what that looks like

92
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,032
now that we have all these parents for it.

93
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:10,021
And we can see here that we have these,

94
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:13,016
in this case, eight conditioning cases,

95
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:18,031
correspond[ing] to three variables, two values each.

96
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:22,075
And so here just to look at one of the samples,

97
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:26,004
just as an example, distribution for example.

98
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:30,074
So, if this is a fairly new vehicle—after 2000—

99
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:32,039
and it’s an SUV,

100
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,072
the probability of having a severe accident is quite low.

101
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:38,081
and the probability of having a mild accident is moderate

102
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:44,077
and the probability of having of no accidents is 0.85

103
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:48,052
whereas if you compare that to corresponding entry

104
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:52,005
when we keep everything fixed except that now it’s a compact car,

105
00:04:52,005 --> 00:05:00,050
we see that the probability of having a mild accident is lower,

106
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,004
but the probability of having no accidents is higher,

107
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:08,005
representing different driving patterns, for example.

108
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,064
Okay, so with this network,

109
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:13,064
we can now start asking simple questions.

110
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,014
So to do some example of causal inference,

111
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:20,055
let’s instantiate, for example, driving quality to be good.

112
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,093
And bad.

113
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:27,005
And we can see that for bad driver

114
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:31,039
the probability of low cost is 81%.

115
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,032
And for a good driver the probability of low cost is 87%.

116
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:38,038
If we look at the accidents

117
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,027
we can see that for a good driver

118
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:44,079
there is a probability of 87.5 percent of no accidents

119
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,043
and ten percent of mild accident.

120
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:50,095
And the probability of no accident goes down for a bad driver,

121
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:53,042
and mild accident goes up

122
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:55,045
and severe accidents also goes way up.

123
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:59,007
Now note that many of these differences are quite subtle.

124
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:02,005
There’s a difference of a couple percent one way or the other.

125
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:04,003
And you might think,

126
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:05,032
if you were designing a network,

127
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:09,024
that you’d like these really extreme probability changes

128
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,048
when you instantiate values.

129
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,079
But in many cases that’s not actually true,

130
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,005
and these subtle differences

131
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,064
are actually quite significant for an insurance company

132
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:19,081
that insures hundreds of thousands of people—

133
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,049
a couple of percentage points in the probability of an accident

134
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,085
can make a very big difference to one’s profitability.

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,097
So now let’s think about

136
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:29,051
how we would expand this network even further.

137
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:33,024
Vehicle size and vehicle year are things

138
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:35,085
that we’re likely to observe in the insurance forum.

139
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:39,007
But driver quality is something that’s very difficult to observe.

140
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:41,082
You can’t go ask somebody, “Oh, are you a good driver?”

141
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:43,045
Because everyone’s going to say,

142
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:45,012
“Sure, I’m the best driver ever!”

143
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:49,027
And so that’s not going to be a very useful question.

144
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:53,014
So what evidence do we have that we can observe

145
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:57,014
that might indicate to us the value of the driver quality?

146
00:06:57,014 --> 00:07:01,049
One obvious one is the person’s driving record.

147
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:03,055
That is, whether they’ve had previous accidents

148
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,035
or previous moving violations.

149
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,041
So let’s think about adding a variable

150
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,087
that represents driving history.

151
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:13,050
And so let’s go ahead and introduce that variable.

152
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,031
So we can click on this button

153
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:17,069
that allows us to create a node.

154
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,084
The node is now called variable1

155
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:21,003
so we’d have to give it a name.

156
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:24,078
So for example we’re going to call it DrivingHistory.

157
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:28,007
And that’s its identifier,

158
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:30,061
and we also have the name of the variable,

159
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:32,024
which is usually the same.

160
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:35,019
And let’s make that two values,

161
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,072
say PreviousAccident and NoPreviousAccident.

162
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:45,075
Now where will we place this variable in the network?

163
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:48,082
One might initially think that the right thing to do

164
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:53,022
is to place DrivingHistory as a parent of Driver_quality

165
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:57,014
because driving history can influence

166
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,004
our beliefs about driver quality.

167
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:01,029
Now it’s true that observing driving history

168
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,065
changes our probability within driver quality,

169
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,044
but if you think about the actual causal structure of this scenario,

170
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:11,087
what we actually have is that driver quality is a causal factor

171
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:13,096
of both a previous accident

172
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:16,076
as well as a subsequent accident.

173
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:18,032
And so if we want to maintain

174
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,042
the intuitive causal structure of the domain,

175
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:28,009
a more appropriate thing is to add DrivingHistory as a child

176
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,097
rather than parent of Driver_quality.

177
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:32,018
[You] might question why it matters

178
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:33,086
and in this very simple example

179
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:36,087
the two models are in some sense equivalent

180
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:38,085
and we could have placed it either way

181
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:44,007
except that the CPD for driver quality given driving history

182
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,000
might be a little bit less intuitive.

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,095
But if we had other indicators of driver quality,

184
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,043
for example a previous moving violation,

185
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:55,066
then it actually makes a lot more sense

186
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:58,055
to have all of these be children of driver quality

187
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:00,092
as opposed to parents of driver quality.

188
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,068
Okay.

189
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:07,048
So that shows us how we would add a variable into the network.

190
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,076
And now let’s go and open up a much larger network

191
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:13,000
that includes these variables as well as others.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,097
So let’s look now at this larger network.

193
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,034
And we can see

194
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:20,023
that we’ve added several different variables to the network.

195
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:23,021
We’ve added attributes of the vehicle,

196
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:27,028
for example whether the vehicle had antilock brakes and an airbag,

197
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,078
which is going to allow us to give

198
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:31,048
more informative probabilities regarding the accident.

199
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:35,022
We’ve also introduced aspects of the driver,

200
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:38,024
for example, whether they’ve had extra-track training,

201
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,008
which is going to increase driving quality,

202
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:41,068
whether they’re young or old,

203
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:42,095
where the presumption is

204
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:45,088
that younger people tend to be more reckless drivers,

205
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:50,037
and whether the driver is focused or more easily distracted,

206
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:52,084
which again is going to affect driving quality.

207
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:58,068
Now since personality type is hard to observe,

208
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:03,015
we added another variable which is Good_student

209
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:05,065
which might indicate one’s personality type.

210
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:08,086
So let’s open [the] CPD for that one.

211
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,007
And so we can see here that, for example,

212
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:20,099
if you are a focused person who is young,

213
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:23,071
you’re much more likely to be a good student,

214
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:28,043
much more so than if you are not a focused person who is young.

215
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:32,030
If you’re old, you’re just not very likely to be a student,

216
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:38,002
and so this probability basically says that if you’re old,

217
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:39,088
you’re just not very likely to be a student,

218
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:41,032
and therefore not likely to be a good student.

219
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:47,060
So, now that we’ve added all these variables to the network,

220
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,016
let’s go ahead and run a few queries to see what happens.

221
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:56,091
And let’s start by looking at the prior probability of Accident

222
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:59,094
before we observe anything.

223
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:04,029
So we can see that the probability of no accident is about 79.5%.

224
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,006
The probability of severe accident is about 3%.

225
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:10,007
Now let’s go ahead and tell the system

226
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:11,083
that we have a good student at hand.

227
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,060
So we’re going to observe

228
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,097
that the student is a good student,

229
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:17,056
and let’s see what happens.

230
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,069
We can see, surprisingly,

231
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,080
that even though we observe

232
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,088
that somebody is a good student,

233
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:23,095
the probability of no accidents

234
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:27,069
went down from 79.5% to 78%,

235
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,058
and the probability of severe accidents

236
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:32,081
went up to 3.5 to 3.67 percent.

237
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:33,087
You might say,

238
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:35,098
“Well, but I *told* you that it’s a good student.

239
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:38,013
Shouldn’t the probability of accidents go down?”

240
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,097
So let’s look at some active trails in this graph.

241
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:46,046
One active trail goes from Good_student to Focused,

242
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,092
to Driver_quality,

243
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:49,093
to Accident.

244
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:53,060
And sure enough, if we consider that trail in isolation,

245
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,037
it’s probably going to make the probability of no accident be higher.

246
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:00,020
But, we have another active trail.

247
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,005
We have the active trail that goes from good student up to age,

248
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:07,008
and then back down, through [to] driver quality.

249
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,092
So, to see that, let’s unclick on good student

250
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:11,028
and see what happens.

251
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:15,076
Note that the probability initially that the driver is young was 25%,

252
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:17,071
but when I observed a good student,

253
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,053
it went up to close to 95%.

254
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:23,014
And that was enough to counteract the influence

255
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:27,044
along this more obvious active trail.

256
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:31,055
So, to demonstrate that this is indeed what’s going on,

257
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:35,078
let’s click on the fact

258
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:38,041
and instantiate the fact that the student is young,

259
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:43,044
and we can see that the probability of severe accident went up to 3.7%

260
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:47,096
and no accident went down to a little bit shy of 77%.

261
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:51,055
And now let’s observe good student and see what happens.

262
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:53,017
So now we observed good student,

263
00:12:53,017 --> 00:13:01,065
and the probability of no accidents went down to 78%,

264
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:07,003
as opposed to before when it was 77%.

265
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:10,055
And the reason for that

266
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,077
is that we’ve now blocked this trail

267
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:15,087
that goes from good student, through age, to driver quality

268
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,091
by observing this variable which blocks the trail.

269
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:20,062
So we can see the reasoning patterns

270
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:24,098
in a Bayesian network are sometimes subtle.

271
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:28,063
And there are different trails that can affect things

272
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:31,074
and interact with each other in different ways.

273
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:34,069
And so it’s useful to take the model

274
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:36,031
and play around with different queries

275
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:37,073
and different combinations of evidence

276
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:40,002
to understand the behavior of a network.

277
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,034
And especially if you’re designing

278
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:43,078
such a network for a particular application,

279
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,029
it’s useful to try out these different queries

280
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,005
and see if the behavior that you get

281
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:49,070
is the behavior that you want to get.

282
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,007
And if not, then you need to thing about

283
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:55,096
how do I modify this network to get behavior

284
00:13:55,096 --> 00:14:00,049
that’s more analogous to the desired behavior.

285
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:03,075
This network is available for you to play with

286
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,000
and you can try out different things

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,096
and see what behaviors you get.
