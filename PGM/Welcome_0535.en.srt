00:00:00,021 --> 00:00:04,014
Hello everyone, and welcome to the class on probabilistic graphical models.

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:07,064
My name is Daphne Kohler and I’m a professor at Stanford University.

3
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:09,061
We here at Stanford are really excited

4
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:12,020
to be able to offer this graduate level Stanford class

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,075
to anyone, anywhere around the world for free.

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:18,048
So what are probabilistic graphical models?

7
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:20,075
Well, it’s a bit complicated to explain

8
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:24,009
and we’re going to talk about that in an upcoming video

9
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:26,019
but also throughout the entire class.

10
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,071
In this video, I’d like to tell you a little bit about the format of this class.

11
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:32,081
The course is going to be offered over ten weeks worth of material

12
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,079
plus a final examination at the end.

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,006
The content is going to be conveyed via a set of videos,

14
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,031
augmented with quizzes to reinforce understanding.

15
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,049
In addition, there is going to be a weekly problem set

16
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:50,004
where the problem sets altogether are going to be worth 25% of the score

17
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:53,047
for a total of the nine problem sets for the nine weeks worth of content.

18
00:00:53,047 --> 00:00:56,056
The problem sets are designed to allow for multiple submissions,

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,062
so that each version of the problem set is going to be a little bit different

20
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:04,004
so that you can resubmit the same problem set [a] couple of times

21
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,062
to make sure that you really mastered the material.

22
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:10,096
In addition, there’s going to be a weekly programming assignment,

23
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:13,085
and those programming assignments were selected

24
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:17,097
to reinforce specific concepts that we’re studying in the course,

25
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:21,034
but at the same time to reveal the range of applications

26
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:25,043
to which the framework of probabilistic graphical models can be successfully applied.

27
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,028
So we’re going to have, for example,

28
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:30,036
[a] problem set on how you use probabilistic graphical models

29
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:33,063
to understand the inheritance of genetically inherited diseases.

30
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:35,064
We’re going to have one that shows

31
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:38,096
how you can look at a set of handwritten characters

32
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:40,093
and read what’s written there.

33
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:44,008
And we’re going to have one that allows you

34
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:47,064
to look at a stream of output from a Kinect sensor

35
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:49,075
that gives you both video and range data

36
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,016
and recognize human activities.

37
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:56,045
These nine programming assignments are each going to be worth 7% of the score

38
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:58,008
for a total of 63%,

39
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,040
which gives us twelve percent left for the final exam.

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,048
What background do you need for this class?

41
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:07,053
Well, it’s going to be really hard to do this class,

42
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:11,004
without some understanding of basic probability theory.

43
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:13,008
This doesn’t have to be very advanced stuff.

44
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,017
We’re talking about things like independence and Bayes rule.

45
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:18,071
And just basics of discrete distributions.

46
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,061
And we also have a few introductory modules

47
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:23,068
to refresh your memory about these basic concepts.

48
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:26,094
The programming assignments will require

49
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:29,041
that you’ve had some experience programming before

50
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,087
because this is not a programming class.

51
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,095
We don’t teach you how to program.

52
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:37,038
And because this class merges ideas from both probability theory and computer science,

53
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:41,024
it’s really important you have some background in algorithms and data structures.

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,047
Recommended, but not strictly necessary—

55
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,059
and we certainly don’t require it,

56
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,071
and we give you the background as we go—

57
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:52,028
is a little bit of experience, perhaps, in machine learning,

58
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:55,036
maybe some simple optimization like gradient descent,

59
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:57,044
nothing very sophisticated.

60
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:01,048
And it would be helpful to have some experience programming in Matlab or Octave,

61
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,036
although, here also, we have some introductory modules

62
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:08,033
that help you learn this programming language if you haven’t played around with it before.

63
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,048
A few other issues that are worth noting:

64
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:14,055
This class has an honor code.

65
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:19,001
This is the norm also for our local Stanford students when they’re taking a Stanford class.

66
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,083
The honor code here says that you’re allowed to discuss the material,

67
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:26,058
in fact even encouraged to discuss the material with your fellow classmates.

68
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:30,080
You can even ask clarifying questions about the problems sets and the programming assignments.

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,099
But what you turn in has to be your own work.

70
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:39,053
Furthermore, we request that you do not post either the programming assignments

71
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,071
or their solutions anywhere on the web,

72
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:44,060
so that future generations of students can do

73
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,044
the problems sets and the programming assignments independently as well.

74
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:52,035
A second issue to keep in mind is that of time management.

75
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:54,037
This is a graduate-level Stanford class

76
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,086
and it’s considered a difficult one even at Stanford.

77
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:59,014
A typical Stanford student can easily spend

78
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:01,007
ten to fifteen hours a week on this class,

79
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,090
and so we would suggest that you budget

80
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,079
at least that amount of time for your own efforts on this class

81
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,029
if you don’t want to find yourself running out of time

82
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,037
when a submission deadline comes around.

83
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:13,034
We’ve built in a little slack into the submission deadline,

84
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:17,065
so if you don’t manage to submit by the original deadline,

85
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:19,036
you have a week’s worth of grace period.

86
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:22,097
But then that obviously starts to impinge on the next week’s problem set.

87
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:25,043
So we advise that you don’t just keep

88
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:28,051
a backlog of assignments throughout the course,

89
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:31,048
because it will all end up coming back to bite you in the end.

90
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:36,034
Finally, part of the experience of this class

91
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,059
is interacting with your fellow students,

92
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:41,044
so for that purpose we have the discussion forum

93
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,026
which has proven in other classes

94
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:46,052
to be an invaluable resource for interacting with other students,

95
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,078
asking questions and obtaining a deeper understanding of the material.

96
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:52,041
We’re also encouraging you to form study groups—

97
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,089
these can be physical study groups with people in the same geographical region,

98
00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:00,027
or online study groups where you can just discuss the material with each other.

99
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:01,083
We believe that doing this

100
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,093
will give you a much better understanding of the material

101
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:06,083
and will make the course considerably more fun as well.

102
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,036
So, to summarize,

103
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:14,099
through all these different pieces of the content and the exercises,

104
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:17,083
we think that you’ll learn fundamental methods

105
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,088
in this area of probabilistic graphical models.

106
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:22,034
You’ll also get to see and play around with

107
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:25,087
a range of real-world applications for which these methods have been applied

108
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:29,034
and hopefully you will leave this class with an understanding

109
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:32,031
of how to take these ideas and use them in your own work

110
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,087
in problems that you care about.

111
00:05:33,087 --> 99:59:59,000
We look forward to seeing you in this class.
