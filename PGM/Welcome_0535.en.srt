00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,035
Hello everyone, and welcome to the class
on probabilistic graphical models. My name

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:08,060
is Daphne Kohler and I'm a professor at
Stanford University. We here at Stanford

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,068
are really excited to be able to offer
this graduate level Stanford class to

4
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:16,084
anyone, anywhere around the world, for
free. So what are [inaudible] graphical

5
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:21,042
models? Well, it's a bit complicated to
explain and we're going to talk about that

6
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:26,000
in an upcoming video but also throughout
the entire class. In this video, I'd like

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,063
to tell you a little bit about the format
of this class. The course is going to be

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:35,038
offered over ten weeks worth of material
plus a final examination at the end. The

9
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:39,082
content is going to be conveyed via a set
of videos, augmented with quizzes to

10
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:44,076
reinforce understanding. In addition there
is going to be a weekly problem set where

11
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:49,008
the problem sets altogether are going to
be worth 25 percent of the score for total

12
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:53,052
of the nine problem sets for the nine
weeks worth of content. The problem sets

13
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:57,078
are designed to allow for multiple
submissions, so that each version of the

14
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:02,027
problem set is going to be a little bit
different so that you can resubmit the

15
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:07,010
same problem set couple of times to make
sure that you really master the material.

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,038
In addition, there's going to be a weekly
programming assignment and those

17
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:15,099
programming assignments were selected to
reinforce specific concepts that we're

18
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:20,061
studying in the course. But, at the same
time, to reveal the range of applications

19
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:24,094
to which the framework of [inaudible]
graphical models can be successfully

20
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:28,098
applied. So we're going to have, for
example problem set on how you use

21
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:33,083
[inaudible] graphical models to understand
the inheritance of genetically inherited

22
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,004
diseases. We're going to have one that
shows how you can look at a set of

23
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:42,085
handwritten characters and read what's
written there. And we're going to have one

24
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:47,098
that allows you to look at a stream of
output from a connect, sensor, that gives

25
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:52,071
you both video and range data, and
recognize, human activities. These nine

26
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:57,070
programming assignments are each going to
be worth seven percent of the score for a

27
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,080
total of 63%, which gives us twelve
percent left for the final exam. What

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,031
background do you need for this class?
Well, it's gonna be really hard to do this

29
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:11,012
class, without some understanding of basic
probability theory. This doesn't have to

30
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:15,052
be very advanced stuff. We're talking
about things like independence and Bayes

31
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:19,047
rule. And just basics of discreet
distributions. And we also have a few

32
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:23,085
introductory modules to refresh your
memory about these basic concepts. The

33
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:28,000
programming assignments, will require that
you have some experience programming

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,025
before because this is not a programming
class. We don't teach you how to program.

35
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:36,034
And because this class merges ideas from
both probability theory and computer

36
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:40,043
science, it's really important you have
some background in algorithms and data

37
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:45,023
structures. Recommended, but not strictly
necessary. And we certainly don't require

38
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:49,082
it, and we give you the background as we
go. Is a little bit of experience,

39
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:54,072
perhaps, in machine learning. Maybe some
simple optimization, like gradient descent

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,043
nothing very sophisticated. And it would
be helpful to have some experience

41
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:04,020
[inaudible]. Although here, also, we have
some introductory modules that help you

42
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:09,009
learn this programming language if you
haven't played around with it before. A

43
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:13,079
few other issues that are worth noting.
This class has an honor code. This is the

44
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:18,008
norm, also, for our local Stanford
students when they're taking a Stanford

45
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:22,066
class. The honor code here says that
you're allowed to discuss the material. In

46
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:27,019
fact, even encouraged to discuss the
material with your fellow classmates. You

47
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,095
can even ask clarifying questions about
the problems [inaudible] assignments. But

48
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:36,083
what you turn in has to be your own work.
Furthermore, we request that you do not.

49
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:41,056
Post either the programming assignments,
or their solutions anywhere on the web, so

50
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:45,084
that future generations of students, can
do the problems [inaudible]. The problem

51
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:49,062
sets and the [inaudible] assignments
independently as well. [sound] A second

52
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,016
issue to keep in mind is that of time
management. This is a graduate-level

53
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,090
Stanford class and it's considered a
difficult one even at Stanford. A typical

54
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,087
Stanford student can easily spend ten to
fifteen hours a week on this class. And so

55
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:04,084
we would suggest that you budget at least
that amount of time, for your own efforts,

56
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:08,048
on this class if you don't want to find
yourself running out of time when a

57
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:12,029
submission deadline comes around. We've
built in a little slack into the

58
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:16,073
submission deadline, so if you don't
manage to submit by the original deadline,

59
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:21,035
you have a week?s worth of grace period.
But then that obviously starts to impinge

60
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:25,085
on the next week's problem set. So we
advise that you don't just keep a backlog

61
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:30,053
of assignments throughout, throughout the
course, because it will all end up coming

62
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:36,005
back to bit you in the end. Finally. Part
of the experience of this class is

63
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:40,018
interacting with your fellow students, so
for that purpose we have the discussion

64
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:44,052
forum which has proven in other classes to
be an invaluable resource for interacting

65
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:48,065
with other students, asking questions and
obtaining a deeper understanding of the

66
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:52,068
material. We're also encouraging you to
form study groups, these can be physical

67
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:56,076
study groups with people in the same
geographical region or online study groups

68
00:04:56,076 --> 00:05:00,074
where you can just discuss the material
with each other. We believe that doing

69
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:04,042
this will give you a much better
understanding of the material and will

70
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:08,091
make the course considerably more fun as
well. So, to summarize through all these

71
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:13,050
different pieces of the content and the
exercises, we think that you learned

72
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,079
fundamental methods in this area of
probabilistic graphical models. You'll

73
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:22,055
also get to see and play around with a
range of real world applications for which

74
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:27,002
these methods have been applied and
hopefully you will leave this class with

75
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:31,048
an understanding of how to take these
ideas and use them in your own work in

76
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:35,072
problems that you care about. We look
forward to seeing you in this class.
