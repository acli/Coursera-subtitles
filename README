This is a collection of all the subtitles I have ever done or
QA’d for the Coursera classes I have taken.

I don’t find UniversalSubtitle’s UI particularly easy to use and
would like some recommendations for a good free (preferably open
source) subtitle editor for use on a Mac.

lectures), please head over to http://w.gniw.ca/?p=735 )

list of all videos you have done)
