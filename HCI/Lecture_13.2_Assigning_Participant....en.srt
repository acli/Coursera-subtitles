1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:08,060
In this video, we're going to talk about
assigning participants to conditions And

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,058
one of the most basic questions you can
ask about this is, should every

3
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,051
participant use every alternative. To
illustrate this, we're going to walk

4
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:21,006
through an example. We're going to see the
trade off that are intrinsic to different

5
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:25,060
approaches that you can take here. In this
study we're going to compare smart vacuum

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:37,061
cleaner With more traditional vacuum
cleaner. As you remember from last time,

7
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:43,005
one of the first questions we should ask
about this are, what are the measures do

8
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:47,068
we want something that is faster, or
cleaner, or less fatigue that are

9
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:52,077
ergonomics, lower environmental impact,
affordability, easy views, fewer errors.

10
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:58,034
Any of these are valid measures you might
keep track of them all. For our example

11
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:03,059
here though, we're, we're going to pick
two. We're going to go with the faster and

12
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,053
we're going to go with cleaner. So our
manipulation is going to be back in type

13
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:14,005
and our measure is going to be speed and
cleanliness. To help illustrate this

14
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:20,019
example, I'm going to recruit the help of
my graduate students and TA's. And so here

15
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:25,074
they are. One thing you can imagine is
that you assign half of them to each

16
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:31,029
condition. That's called the between
subjects design and so we could assign

17
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:39,009
half of them to the robot interface And we
can assign half of them to the traditional

18
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:45,094
interface. So, Chinma, Nicholas and Alex
get the robot And Dan, Ronjita and Jesse

19
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:52,070
get the traditional one. And let's say for
example, that the robotic interface

20
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:58,083
performs better, faster and cleaner. With
only six people, it's hard to say whether

21
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:04,048
it's because the, the vacuum cleaner there
is better or whether the three people that

22
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:09,040
we have been assigned to it Chinma,
Nicholas and Alex were better cleaners

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,052
than Dan, Jesse and Ronjita. So, the
strategy is within subject design where we

24
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:19,084
could have everybody use both interfaces.
Wonder what they're going to use first, if

25
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:25,022
they use the old interface face or gotten
practice and maybe extra good or maybe

26
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:30,099
tired when they get to use the new one And
vice versa. So between subje ct's designs,

27
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:36,027
have to worry about individual differences
within subject's designs have a worry

28
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:41,056
about ordering effects. Is there some way
that we can get the best of both worlds?

29
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:47,025
Well, how might we address these ordering
effects? Well, one thing that we could do

30
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:52,029
is we could take half of the people and
have them try one interface first. In the

31
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:58,087
other path and try the, try the other
interface first. Counter balancing has a

32
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:03,052
couple of nice properties. For starters,
you can treat it as completely a between

33
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:09,009
subject's design if you look at only the
first task that people do. And hopefully,

34
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:14,083
the benefit that you get from practicing
or the discriminative fatigue is roughly

35
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:20,036
the same in both condition and both even
itself about and so kind of balancing

36
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:26,024
watches out some of those concerns. There
are times where this is isn't the case and

37
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:31,003
that's a great time to use between
subjects design. To minimize the learning

38
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,093
effects is probably best to make the first
and second task different. So in this

39
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:38,080
case, we might have people clean the D
School as their first task and clean the

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,075
Gates building as their second. This also
has the added benefit of giving us some

41
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:46,086
more ecological validity by trying out a
couple of different environment so we know

42
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:50,082
it's not just the Gates building that's
better cleaned by robots. It also has the

43
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:54,060
benefit to build the D School and the
Gates building are clean. How about

44
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,097
individual differences? Should we try to
balance for shirt color, hair length,

45
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:05,037
gender, or whether the picture in the icon
is square-ish or more rectangular? It

46
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:10,007
depends on whether you think it's going to
make a difference in the study or whether

47
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:14,073
one might possibly believe that it would
make a difference in the study. Simple

48
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:18,013
thing to do is choose the random
assignment. We'll talk about more

49
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:22,022
sophisticated techniques in a couple of
slides. Okay. So now we know a couple of

50
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:26,006
ways of dealing with two different
alternatives. But what if we have three?

51
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:30,001
With three alternatives you can use
something called the Latin Square. I'll

52
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:34,064
explain how this works with thr ee
conditions that generalizes more. In a

53
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:39,038
classic Latin square design, each person
is going to use all three conditions.

54
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:44,059
You'll randomly divide your participants
up in three different groups. The first

55
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:49,074
group is going to get the first one first,
the second one second and the third one

56
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:54,043
third. The second group two, three, one
And the third one three, one, two, So

57
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:59,096
again, everybody gets all there conditions
But their order changes and if you look at

58
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:05,004
any particular order segment so like what
people see first or what people see

59
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:10,032
second, what people see third. You can see
that is also evenly balanced across the

60
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:15,008
three conditions. Maybe choose between
subject approaches or within subject's

61
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:20,006
approach. The most important thing to do
is to make sure that the odds that any

62
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:24,053
particular participant ends up in a
particular condition or particular

63
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:29,070
condition ordering is completely random as
even. We can illustrate this as with an

64
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,049
example. Say you wanted to find out
whether people were faster typing in the

65
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:39,078
morning or typing in the afternoon and you
allow to people to come in whenever they

66
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:43,083
want. What if you will ever have
preference for the morning, morning people

67
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:47,047
or faster typers and people who have a
preference for the afternoon? Your

68
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:51,031
conclusion is that morning, maybe the
morning was faster but that's not right

69
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:55,004
because it's just the morning people who
are faster not that there's something

70
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:59,008
about the, the morning or maybe not, you
can't say confound. It's possible that the

71
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:03,001
causal reason was population difference
and not experimental manipulation This

72
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:07,000
confounds, as well rather than economic is
so hard and computing correlations but

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,052
there is no manipulations. Random
assignment as tool number one in achieving

74
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:17,001
a effective manipulation. So in our typing
case you would want to assign people to be

75
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:21,071
in either the morning condition or the
afternoon condition. The morning and

76
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:25,090
afternoon example can seem kind of
stylized but it shows a lot of real world.

77
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,043
For example, if you're running a website,
one easy thing that you might do is show

78
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:34,090
everybody one alternativ e on one day and
one alternative on the next. Well there

79
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,038
may be a difference between those days.
We'll talk more about running experiments

80
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,074
later on but for now I wanted to point out
that the key is, if you're going to do

81
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:48,094
something like this make sure that people
are randomly assigned. Easiest way in most

82
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:55,064
cases is, is between subjects design where
you assign people as they come in to see

83
00:06:55,064 --> 00:07:01,050
either one interface or the other. Here's
another example of the importance of

84
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,083
random assignment. In the 1930s, some
studies were run at the Western Electric

85
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:12,044
factory outside Chicago called Hawthorne
and the plan was pretty simple. Find out

86
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:17,050
whether changes in lightning levels
affected productivity. So, experiments

87
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,075
came in. Raise the lightning levels,
productivity goes up. Then they tried

88
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:26,088
lowering the light levels, productivity
went up Tried a whole bunch of

89
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:31,041
combinations. After each intervention,
productivity went up. The conclusion of

90
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:36,042
course is that it's the active intervening
rather than the light levels itself which

91
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:40,072
was the major course behind the
productivity change presumably other the

92
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:45,050
workers felt like people cared about them
or the excitement of the experiment or

93
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,013
whatever. That was the driving factor. In
recent years some economist, have

94
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:55,004
questioned whether in fact there was a
Hawthorne effect at the Hawthorne plan. If

95
00:07:55,004 --> 00:08:00,006
you're curious you can Google more about
that. In either case the name is stuck and

96
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:04,073
it means a case where what you're seeing
is your effect is the result of the

97
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:09,063
intervention rather than the thing that
you're trying to study and you can avoid

98
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:14,017
this with random assignment. We talked
about counter balancing the order of

99
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:18,062
conditions that participants experience.
You can also counter balance how you

100
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:22,090
assign people the conditions. Say for
example you're worried that typing speed

101
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,012
will differentially affect something in
your interface; you're building a new

102
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:31,090
spread sheet or something like that. You
could use a pretest to establish typing

103
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:37,003
speed ahead of time and use that to assign
people to conditions. There's many

104
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:42,011
techniques for doing this. Simplest way to
do it is just look at high speed typers

105
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:47,019
versus low speed typers. The key no matter
what is that each participant has an equal

106
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:52,030
chance of ending up in either condition.
Let's walk through an example. If you can

107
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,061
pretest everyone ahead of time, most
likely that you can do is form match

108
00:08:56,061 --> 00:09:01,074
pairs. So say we get the typing speed that
we see here, after ordering they look like

109
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:07,087
this. We can group them into pairs and
then for each pair, we can conceptually

110
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:12,088
flip a coin about which of them is going
to land in which of the two conditions. I

111
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:18,002
got one of these dollar coins to the take
out machine the other day and it'll do

112
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:28,038
well for flipping, So for 35 and 37 Heads
so we'll put 35 down here. First

113
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:42,096
condition, 37 goes in the second And for
57 versus 59. It's tails so 59 goes here.

114
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:57,003
[sound]. There is the heads so that gives
us 61, 68 Entails And, that gives us 99

115
00:09:57,003 --> 00:10:02,095
goes here and 70 goes here. By doing this
match pairs, you're balancing out the

116
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:09,002
performance of people approximately in
each condition. And, by having some random

117
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:14,087
list in there, you're ensuring that you
don't get some accidental statistical

118
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:21,016
artifacts that creep in by saying sign all
your odds here and all your evens there.

119
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:25,023
The type of people are coming in online so
you can't pretest people for the

120
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:29,067
experiment. But what you can do is you can
pick some threshold that you think is in

121
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:33,095
about the middle. So, if for typing, you
might say 65 words a minute and as people

122
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:41,034
come in. You can check whether they're
above or below that threshold and label

123
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:49,001
are high, high or low, fast or slow typers
based on that. So 35 we would say is low.

124
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:56,030
40 is low. 90 is high. 68 is high and so
on and you can assign them to your two

125
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:11,010
different conditions. We call them A, B
High and low, So our first low person to

126
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:20,044
come in 35, Tails, so that will go to B
And then the balance that out 40 will go

127
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:26,016
heads. Next time we got a pair of lows,
we're going to flip the coin again and

128
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:32,035
we're going to do that for the highs also.
So the highs come in and, heads. So our

129
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:39,057
first high will go to A and our secon d
high will go to B. You don't need to make

130
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:43,092
sure that you had even numbers of high and
low typers unless you worry about that

131
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:47,084
making the material difference on in the
outcome. In fact, you have many

132
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:52,018
participants; you can look at this, two by
two grid and compare the outcomes of the

133
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:56,091
four cells. What you do need to make sure
is that there are the same number of fast

134
00:11:56,091 --> 00:12:01,074
typers of high in a and in b and the same
number or slow typers are low in a and in

135
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:06,011
b. There's a lot of ways that you can do
these kinds of counter-balancing. In

136
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:10,042
general, all of them much are giving the
same thing which is trying to help

137
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:15,014
[inaudible] enlarge numbers that you get
in a between subject study work a little

138
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:20,056
bit faster. Now, there's a danger of
assigning people based on a pretest that I

139
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:25,099
like to warn you about. Say, we want to
pretest for coins that are more like to

140
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:32,013
come up ahead. So, I have some coins here.
I can flip each of these a couple of times

141
00:12:32,013 --> 00:13:30,036
and. Okay. That one's heads more. So it
was really heads more. Tails. Tails. That

142
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:51,069
was tails. Heads And what else, [sound]
So, we have three coins that had a heavy

143
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:59,006
tendency and three coins that have a
tailey tendency. Now, we can feed them a

144
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:06,030
the snack so we can a bagel. In fact, this
is the same bagel in the last lecture. So

145
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:12,078
with bagels, so it's not such a fresh
bagel anymore. But nonetheless it will

146
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:19,067
give our coins some sustenance so we can
give them each, each sound of bagel and we

147
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:26,088
want to see whether our [sound] Heady
coins become more or so and whether tailey

148
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:31,064
coins become more or so. So, we think by
the natural tendencies of this coins is

149
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:36,028
one direction by feeding them. I, I think
that may make them more or so. So, the

150
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:40,062
questions we're going to ask is whether
the snacking increases the natural

151
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:45,044
tendencies of coins. And we can re-flip
all of these and I wouldn't inflict that

152
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:50,026
on you right now. But you can try yourself
and what you'll see, of course, is that

153
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:54,078
none of these coins really had a, a
tendency towards head or tail, it's just

154
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,086
that on a small number of samples. You
know if you came out with a little b it

155
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:02,070
more heads, if you came out a little bit
of more tails and if you flip them again

156
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,064
there will be no co-relation between their
heads in tendency in the first half and

157
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:11,012
their heads in tendency in the second
half. To make it a little more exciting

158
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:17,031
than just the six coins that I have in my
pocket, I decided to generate 30 coins in

159
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:23,014
excel and I flip them each 21 times and
you can see the results here of how many

160
00:15:23,014 --> 00:15:28,097
heads each got out of 21 toss. I picked an
odd number so that it would have to be

161
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:35,055
either heady or taily on the hole. And
what we can see if we rank them by number

162
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:42,073
is it turns out actually fifteen of them
had a head tendency. Fifteen had a tail

163
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:50,000
and the average of the heads is 12.9 and
the average of our tail tendency is 8.3.

164
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,075
Now, after I flip in the snack, I can flip
that again. And I have highlighted in

165
00:15:56,075 --> 00:16:03,024
yellow and bold it again that the, the
numbers that have a, a head tendency and

166
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:10,074
there's essentially no correlation between
here. It does turn out that our heads our

167
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:16,051
initial heads. Have an average of 10.7
after eating the bagel and our initial

168
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:22,009
tails have an average of 9.6. So we can
see that both of these regressed towards

169
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:28,040
the mean, both of these are closer towards
the expected value of ten and a half. We

170
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,031
may see a perceived different here between
the 9.6 and the 10.7. In the future

171
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:38,053
lecture we'll learn how to test whether
that's a real difference or whether that's

172
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:43,063
a statistical mirage. So this danger is
actually is very real and it shows up all

173
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:49,003
the time in statistical analysis of things
like low performing schools increasing the

174
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:53,071
next year or high performing schools
decreasing. The assignment problem that

175
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:58,056
results in regression to the mean is when
you're making something like a dividing

176
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:02,094
line and you're using the assignment so
everybody who scores high goes up,

177
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:07,031
everybody who scores low goes down and
then you measure their performance

178
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:11,075
subsequently. If in steady you use a
pretest to counter balance like we did

179
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:16,054
with the typist, so we put high and low
speed typists in both conditions, then you

180
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:20,085
no longer have that worr y about
regression to the mean. So, the major

181
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:27,032
question that we tackled here is should
every participant use every alternative?

182
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:33,060
And whether emerged was three nature
strategies. And in within subject design,

183
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,067
everybody tries all the options. This has
big benefits in terms of recruiting

184
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:42,000
participants. You get more, more work out
of its coercion and it works really well

185
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,011
if you are not working about learning or
practice or exposures and trying one

186
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:52,022
version to pollute the other one And in
between subject study, each person tries

187
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:56,020
one condition. This requires more people
and you may want to consider

188
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,071
counterbalancing for fair assignment. It
has the benefit of course that each

189
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:05,058
participant is uncorrupted and for this
reason is the most common techniques that

190
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:10,075
we see in things like web studies And if
you use it between subject's design, you

191
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:15,065
can use counter balancing to help even
things out. What I offered today is just a

192
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:20,036
really high level over view and I'm
necessarily glossed over a whole bunch of

193
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:25,007
important details but I wanted to give you
an initial lay or land for running

194
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:31,020
studies. If you're interested in more,
more reading in this area. My favorite

195
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:37,090
book in this area is David Martin's book
Doing Psychology Experiments. I'll see you

196
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,066
next time.
