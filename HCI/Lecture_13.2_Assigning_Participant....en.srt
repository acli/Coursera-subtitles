1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:07,837
In this video, we’re going to talk about assigning participants to conditions.

2
00:00:07,837 --> 00:00:14,410
And one of the most basic questions you can ask about this is, should every participant use every alternative.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,437
To illustrate this, we’re going to walk through an example.

4
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:22,950
We’re going to see the trade off that are intrinsic to different approaches that you can take here.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:32,260
In this study we’re going to compare smart vacuum cleaner With more traditional vacuum cleaner.

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:41,013
As you remember from last time, one of the first questions we should ask about this are, 

7
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:45,581
what are the measures do we want something that is faster, or cleaner, 

8
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:52,077
or less fatigue that are ergonomics, lower environmental impact, affordability, easy views, fewer errors.

9
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:56,886
Any of these are valid measures you might keep track of them all.

10
00:00:56,886 --> 00:01:00,998
For our example here though, we’re, we’re going to pick two.

11
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:04,931
We’re going to go with the faster and we’re going to go with cleaner.

12
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:12,181
So our manipulation is going to be back in type and our measure is going to be speed and cleanliness.

13
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:19,141
To help illustrate this example, I’m going to recruit the help of my graduate students and TA’s.

14
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,231
And so here they are.

15
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:26,489
One thing you can imagine is that you assign half of them to each condition.

16
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:34,864
That’s called the between subjects design and so we could assign half of them to the robot interface.

17
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:40,149
And we can assign half of them to the traditional interface.

18
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:43,379
So, Chinma, Nicholas and Alex get the robot.

19
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,584
And Dan, Ronjita and Jesse get the traditional one.

20
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:54,842
And let’s say for example, that the robotic interface performs better, faster and cleaner.

21
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:59,571
With only six people, it’s hard to say whether it’s because the, 

22
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:06,544
the vacuum cleaner there is better or whether the three people that we have been assigned to it Chinma, 

23
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:11,075
Nicholas and Alex were better cleaners than Dan, Jesse and Ronjita.

24
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:16,993
So, the strategy is within subject design where we could have everybody use both interfaces.

25
00:02:16,993 --> 00:02:21,532
Wonder what they’re going to use first, if they use the old interface face 

26
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:27,467
or gotten practice and maybe extra good or maybe tired when they get to use the new one.

27
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:28,608
And vice versa.

28
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:31,239
So between subje ct’s designs, have to worry 

29
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:37,836
about individual differences within subject’s designs have a worry about ordering effects.

30
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:42,097
Is there some way that we can get the best of both worlds?

31
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:45,093
Well, how might we address these ordering effects?

32
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:51,633
Well, one thing that we could do is we could take half of the people and have them try one interface first.

33
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:56,385
In the other path and try the, try the other interface first.

34
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,987
Counter balancing has a couple of nice properties.

35
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:01,507
For starters, you can treat it 

36
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:07,574
as completely a between subject’s design if you look at only the first task that people do.

37
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:14,857
And hopefully, the benefit that you get from practicing or the discriminative fatigue is roughly the same 

38
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:22,592
in both condition and both even itself about and so kind of balancing watches out some of those concerns.

39
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:29,336
There are times where this is isn’t the case and that’s a great time to use between subjects design.

40
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:33,691
To minimize the learning effects is probably best to make the first and second task different.

41
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:36,680
So in this case, we might have people clean the D School 

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,610
as their first task and clean the Gates building as their second.

43
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,506
This also has the added benefit of giving us some more ecological validity by trying out a couple 

44
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:49,200
of different environment so we know it’s not just the Gates building that’s better cleaned by robots.

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,502
It also has the benefit to build the D School and the Gates building are clean.

46
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:55,812
How about individual differences?

47
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:59,097
Should we try to balance for shirt color, hair length, 

48
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:04,797
gender, or whether the picture in the icon is square-ish or more rectangular?

49
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:08,556
It depends on whether you think it’s going to make a difference 

50
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:13,757
in the study or whether one might possibly believe that it would make a difference in the study.

51
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,691
Simple thing to do is choose the random assignment.

52
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:20,274
We’ll talk about more sophisticated techniques in a couple of slides.

53
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:20,939
Okay.

54
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,844
So now we know a couple of ways of dealing with two different alternatives.

55
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:26,006
But what if we have three?

56
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:29,663
With three alternatives you can use something called the Latin Square.

57
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:33,697
I’ll explain how this works with thr ee conditions that generalizes more.

58
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:39,038
In a classic Latin square design, each person is going to use all three conditions.

59
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:43,636
You’ll randomly divide your participants up in three different groups.

60
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:49,605
The first group is going to get the first one first, the second one second and the third one third.

61
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:51,729
The second group two, three, one.

62
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:57,103
And the third one three, one, two, So again, everybody gets all there conditions.

63
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,903
But their order changes and if you look 

64
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:03,704
at any particular order segment so like what people see first 

65
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,934
or what people see second, what people see third.

66
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:11,328
You can see that is also evenly balanced across the three conditions.

67
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:15,840
Maybe choose between subject approaches or within subject’s approach.

68
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,686
The most important thing to do is to make sure that the odds that any particular participant ends up 

69
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:27,275
in a particular condition or particular condition ordering is completely random as even.

70
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:30,065
We can illustrate this as with an example.

71
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:34,435
Say you wanted to find out whether people were faster typing in the morning 

72
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:39,576
or typing in the afternoon and you allow to people to come in whenever they want.

73
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:42,398
What if you will ever have preference for the morning, 

74
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:46,863
morning people or faster typers and people who have a preference for the afternoon?

75
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:50,260
Your conclusion is that morning, maybe the morning was faster 

76
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,911
but that’s not right because it’s just the morning people who are faster not 

77
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:58,150
that there’s something about the, the morning or maybe not, you can’t say confound.

78
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,997
It’s possible that the causal reason was population difference 

79
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:05,491
and not experimental manipulation This confounds, as well rather than economic is so hard 

80
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:08,705
and computing correlations but there is no manipulations.

81
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:13,512
Random assignment as tool number one in achieving a effective manipulation.

82
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:16,587
So in our typing case you would want to assign people 

83
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:20,345
to be in either the morning condition or the afternoon condition.

84
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:25,090
The morning and afternoon example can seem kind of stylized but it shows a lot of real world.

85
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,852
For example, if you’re running a website, one easy thing 

86
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:33,703
that you might do is show everybody one alternativ e on one day and one alternative on the next.

87
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:36,810
Well there may be a difference between those days.

88
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,138
We’ll talk more about running experiments later on but for now I wanted to point out 

89
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:47,053
that the key is, if you’re going to do something like this make sure that people are randomly assigned.

90
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:52,918
Easiest way in most cases is, is between subjects design where you assign people 

91
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,948
as they come in to see either one interface or the other.

92
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:02,457
Here’s another example of the importance of random assignment.

93
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,668
In the 1930s, some studies were run 

94
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:11,579
at the Western Electric factory outside Chicago called Hawthorne and the plan was pretty simple.

95
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,844
Find out whether changes in lightning levels affected productivity.

96
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:18,015
So, experiments came in.

97
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,296
Raise the lightning levels, productivity goes up.

98
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:27,144
Then they tried lowering the light levels, productivity went up Tried a whole bunch of combinations.

99
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:30,136
After each intervention, productivity went up.

100
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:34,513
The conclusion of course is that it’s the active intervening rather than 

101
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:39,542
the light levels itself which was the major course behind the productivity change presumably 

102
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:45,965
other the workers felt like people cared about them or the excitement of the experiment or whatever.

103
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,612
That was the driving factor.

104
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,625
In recent years some economist, 

105
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:54,789
have questioned whether in fact there was a Hawthorne effect at the Hawthorne plan.

106
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,804
If you’re curious you can Google more about that.

107
00:07:57,804 --> 00:08:03,660
In either case the name is stuck and it means a case where what you’re seeing is your effect is the result 

108
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,061
of the intervention rather than the thing that you’re trying 

109
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:10,998
to study and you can avoid this with random assignment.

110
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:16,271
We talked about counter balancing the order of conditions that participants experience.

111
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:19,812
You can also counter balance how you assign people the conditions.

112
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:25,985
Say for example you’re worried that typing speed will differentially affect something in your interface; 

113
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,871
you’re building a new spread sheet or something like that.

114
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:36,046
You could use a pretest to establish typing speed ahead of time and use that to assign people to conditions.

115
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:38,739
There’s many techniques for doing this.

116
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:43,547
Simplest way to do it is just look at high speed typers versus low speed typers.

117
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:49,707
The key no matter what is that each participant has an equal chance of ending up in either condition.

118
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:51,435
Let’s walk through an example.

119
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:56,598
If you can pretest everyone ahead of time, most likely that you can do is form match pairs.

120
00:08:56,598 --> 00:09:01,893
So say we get the typing speed that we see here, after ordering they look like this.

121
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:05,442
We can group them into pairs and then for each pair, 

122
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:11,861
we can conceptually flip a coin about which of them is going to land in which of the two conditions.

123
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:19,617
I got one of these dollar coins to the take out machine the other day and it’ll do well for flipping, 

124
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:27,692
So for 35 and 37 Heads so we’ll put 35 down here.

125
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:33,168
First condition, 37 goes in the second.

126
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:37,956
And for 57 versus 59.

127
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:44,046
It’s tails so 59 goes here.

128
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:45,156
.

129
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:53,296
There is the heads so that gives us 61, 68 Entails.

130
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:59,547
And, that gives us 99 goes here and 70 goes here.

131
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:06,855
By doing this match pairs, you’re balancing out the performance of people approximately in each condition.

132
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:10,901
And, by having some random list in there, you’re ensuring 

133
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,951
that you don’t get some accidental statistical artifacts 

134
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:21,016
that creep in by saying sign all your odds here and all your evens there.

135
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:26,031
The type of people are coming in online so you can’t pretest people for the experiment.

136
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:29,970
But what you can do is you can pick some threshold that you think is in about the middle.

137
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,745
So, if for typing, you might say 65 words a minute and as people come in.

138
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:39,035
You can check whether they’re above or below 

139
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:45,746
that threshold and label are high, high or low, fast or slow typers based on that.

140
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:49,001
So 35 we would say is low.

141
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,453
40 is low.

142
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:51,905
90 is high.

143
00:10:51,905 --> 00:11:00,822
68 is high and so on and you can assign them to your two different conditions.

144
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:16,428
We call them A, B High and low, So our first low person to come in 35, Tails, so that will go to B.

145
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:20,857
And then the balance that out 40 will go heads.

146
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:23,567
Next time we got a pair of lows, 

147
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:28,896
we’re going to flip the coin again and we’re going to do that for the highs also.

148
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,536
So the highs come in and, heads.

149
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:37,075
So our first high will go to A and our secon d high will go to B.

150
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:42,907
You don’t need to make sure that you had even numbers of high and low typers unless you worry about 

151
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:45,846
that making the material difference on in the outcome.

152
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:49,352
In fact, you have many participants; you can look at this, 

153
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:52,642
two by two grid and compare the outcomes of the four cells.

154
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,762
What you do need to make sure is that there are the same number 

155
00:11:55,762 --> 00:12:01,641
of fast typers of high in a and in b and the same number or slow typers are low in a and in b.

156
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:05,799
There’s a lot of ways that you can do these kinds of counter-balancing.

157
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:11,905
In general, all of them much are giving the same thing which is trying to help [inaudible] enlarge numbers 

158
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:15,979
that you get in a between subject study work a little bit faster.

159
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:21,730
Now, there’s a danger of assigning people based on a pretest that I like to warn you about.

160
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,611
Say, we want to pretest for coins that are more like to come up ahead.

161
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:29,203
So, I have some coins here.

162
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:37,287
I can flip each of these a couple of times and.

163
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:46,077
Okay.

164
00:12:46,077 --> 00:13:00,141
That one’s heads more.

165
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:17,721
So it was really heads more.

166
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:22,995
Tails.

167
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:28,269
Tails.

168
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:33,400
That was tails.

169
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,923
Heads.

170
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:46,856
And what else, So, we have three coins 

171
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:56,775
that had a heavy tendency and three coins that have a tailey tendency.

172
00:13:56,775 --> 00:14:01,426
Now, we can feed them a the snack so we can a bagel.

173
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:05,782
In fact, this is the same bagel in the last lecture.

174
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:10,375
So with bagels, so it’s not such a fresh bagel anymore.

175
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:17,100
But nonetheless it will give our coins some sustenance so we can give them each, 

176
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,372
each sound of bagel and we want 

177
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:27,998
to see whether our Heady coins become more or so and whether tailey coins become more or so.

178
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:32,879
So, we think by the natural tendencies of this coins is one direction by feeding them.

179
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,519
I, I think that may make them more or so.

180
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,574
So, the questions we’re going to ask is whether the snacking increases the natural tendencies of coins.

181
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:46,286
And we can re-flip all of these and I wouldn’t inflict that on you right now.

182
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:51,962
But you can try yourself and what you’ll see, of course, is that none of these coins really had a, 

183
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:55,915
a tendency towards head or tail, it’s just that on a small number of samples.

184
00:14:55,915 --> 00:15:00,244
You know if you came out with a little b it more heads, if you came out a little bit 

185
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:04,423
of more tails and if you flip them again there will be no co-relation between their heads 

186
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:08,625
in tendency in the first half and their heads in tendency in the second half.

187
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:13,010
To make it a little more exciting than just the six coins that I have 

188
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:20,021
in my pocket, I decided to generate 30 coins in excel and I flip them each 21 times 

189
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:25,270
and you can see the results here of how many heads each got out of 21 toss.

190
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:31,711
I picked an odd number so that it would have to be either heady or taily on the hole.

191
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:35,055
And what we can see if we rank them by number 

192
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:40,603
is it turns out actually fifteen of them had a head tendency.

193
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:50,000
Fifteen had a tail and the average of the heads is 12.9 and the average of our tail tendency is 8.3.

194
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,194
Now, after I flip in the snack, I can flip that again.

195
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:59,832
And I have highlighted in yellow and bold it again that the, the numbers 

196
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:07,818
that have a, a head tendency and there’s essentially no correlation between here.

197
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:11,268
It does turn out that our heads our initial heads.

198
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:19,126
Have an average of 10.7 after eating the bagel and our initial tails have an average of 9.6.

199
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:22,678
So we can see that both of these regressed towards the mean, 

200
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:27,807
both of these are closer towards the expected value of ten and a half.

201
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:32,225
We may see a perceived different here between the 9.6 and the 10.7.

202
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,539
In the future lecture we’ll learn how to test whether 

203
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:39,903
that’s a real difference or whether that’s a statistical mirage.

204
00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:45,907
So this danger is actually is very real and it shows up all the time in statistical analysis 

205
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:51,642
of things like low performing schools increasing the next year or high performing schools decreasing.

206
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:54,367
The assignment problem that results in regression 

207
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:58,406
to the mean is when you’re making something like a dividing line 

208
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:02,094
and you’re using the assignment so everybody who scores high goes up, 

209
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:07,961
everybody who scores low goes down and then you measure their performance subsequently.

210
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:12,205
If in steady you use a pretest to counter balance like we did with the typist, 

211
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:15,595
so we put high and low speed typists in both conditions, 

212
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:19,204
then you no longer have that worr y about regression to the mean.

213
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:27,032
So, the major question that we tackled here is should every participant use every alternative?

214
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:30,888
And whether emerged was three nature strategies.

215
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:35,052
And in within subject design, everybody tries all the options.

216
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:38,249
This has big benefits in terms of recruiting participants.

217
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:43,169
You get more, more work out of its coercion and it works really well if you are not working 

218
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:49,014
about learning or practice or exposures and trying one version to pollute the other one.

219
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:53,184
And in between subject study, each person tries one condition.

220
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:58,132
This requires more people and you may want to consider counterbalancing for fair assignment.

221
00:17:58,132 --> 00:17:59,716
It has the benefit of course 

222
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:04,823
that each participant is uncorrupted and for this reason is the most common techniques 

223
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:07,258
that we see in things like web studies.

224
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:13,019
And if you use it between subject’s design, you can use counter balancing to help even things out.

225
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:19,223
What I offered today is just a really high level over view and I’m necessarily glossed over a 

226
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,071
whole bunch of important details 

227
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:25,835
but I wanted to give you an initial lay or land for running studies.

228
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:29,975
If you’re interested in more, more reading in this area.

229
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:36,146
My favorite book in this area is David Martin’s book Doing Psychology Experiments.

230
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:38,066
I’ll see you next time.
