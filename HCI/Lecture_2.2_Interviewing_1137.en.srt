1
00:00:02,022 --> 00:00:08,039
In addition to gaining insights from
observing people, It's also valuable to

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,097
interview them, ask them about their
experiences directly. The first step in

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:21,088
setting up an interview is deciding who it
is that you're going to interview. It may

4
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:28,006
seem obvious but The most important thing
is to get people who are representative of

5
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:33,083
the target users of your system. Who are
the people who are going to be using your

6
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:38,089
system? Talk to them, Now they maybe
current users of a similar system if

7
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:44,081
you're creating a better something. You'll
likely find current users and you'll want

8
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:50,009
to learn what they care about, what
problems they see. They might also be

9
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:56,099
nonusers. So, one reason that you might be
building your technology is to broaden the

10
00:00:56,099 --> 00:01:03,056
set of people that can do a certain task
and in that case you wanna talk to the

11
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:10,012
nonusers. Learn about what barriers you
see learn about what their goals are. Say

12
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:16,077
for example, you're designing a lecture
support system. Who would you interview in

13
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:23,073
this case? There's a lot of stake holders.
You might pick the Teacher you might pick

14
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:29,009
The students you might also pick, the
teaching staff. Maybe the department

15
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,061
administrators that are responsible for
making sure the grading is handled

16
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:40,042
properly. Maybe even the parents. It's
important to get different types of users.

17
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:46,081
So, you might have both freshman and a PhD
student. You might have a domestic student

18
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:52,069
and an international student. Somebody
that's in major and out of major, stronger

19
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:58,050
and weaker students, There are lots of
different kinds of users. You can't get

20
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,051
them all but you wanna find several
different people who are representative of

21
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:12,051
major user groups and talk to them. How do
you find these people? Well, one great

22
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:19,047
strategy if you're in the US is to use
Craigslist. You can also reach out through

23
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:24,071
friends and family, your social network is
a powerful tool for finding, finding

24
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:30,014
people to interview. That doesn't just
mean or even primarily mean interview your

25
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:35,058
sister, it means ask your sister who she
might know or ask your friend to put you

26
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:42,085
in touch with people they might know. It's
quite likely that you'll need to pay

27
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:48,059
people. In bay area on Craigslist,
somewhere in the land of 50 to 100 bucks

28
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:54,044
per interview seems to be the going rate.
This gets cheaper if you can have less

29
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:59,099
specialized users. Also, the amount that
you'll need to pay people depends on what

30
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:05,053
they believe it's going to be used for. If
you can convey that in some way you're

31
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:10,080
making the world a better place, people
may be willing to offer their time for

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,013
free even. On the other hand if they
believe that something will be used for a

33
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:21,088
profit they'll likely want a fair wage for
their time. If you're [inaudible] project

34
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:27,080
and don't have enough money to really pay
people. One thing you can do is offer a

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,078
token of appreciation. People often
appreciate a small thoughtful gift that

36
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:37,056
they can actually use like a gift
certificate or some sort, then they do

37
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:43,014
cash. For example, a couple of years ago I
have spoken to a local high school and the

38
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:48,075
students gave me a gift certificate to a
coffee shop. Now, the amount of money

39
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:53,053
there was, was not much But and then,
every time I travel, I could go in the

40
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:59,004
coffee shop in the airport and get a cup
of coffee and reminded me of that group of

41
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:08,066
children and the thoughtfulness. Sometimes
especially early on the design project, it

42
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:15,031
can be difficult to get a hold of exactly
the users that you believe will eventually

43
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:21,056
be the target. In this case don't give up
completely and interview nobody. Do the

44
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:27,065
best you can, approximate if necessary.
For example, if you are designing a system

45
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:33,020
for doctors early on the project, you
might need to satisfy and use medical

46
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,083
students instead of doctors or if you are
working on something for software

47
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:46,048
engineers, you might get Computer Science
students. Not ideal, better than nothing.

48
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:55,098
I've been teaching and doing research in,
computer reaction for about fifteen years

49
00:04:55,098 --> 00:05:02,087
now and I can't tell you how many times
I've talked to students or others who say

50
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:09,000
that. There's nothing to be found that for
the problem that they're tackling. >> It's

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,089
either possible or obvious; it's very
rarely t he case that there is nothing

52
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:19,010
new. The more Monday in the domain, the
more creative you need to be. If you don't

53
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,091
believe me, Malcolm Gladwell the writer,
has a wonderful explanation in the

54
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:29,045
introduction to his new book of collective
stories What the Dog Said. >> The trick to

55
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:34,079
finding ideas is to convince yourself that
everyone and everything has a story to

56
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,086
tell. I say trick but what I really mean
is challenge because it's a very hard

57
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:44,031
thing to do. Shampoo doesn't seem
interesting. Well, damn it. It must be and

58
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:48,099
if it isn't, I have to believe that it
will ultimately leave me somewhere that

59
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:53,088
is. Another trick to finding ideas is
figuring out the difference between power

60
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:58,090
and knowledge. You don't start at the top
if you want to find the story. You start

61
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,005
in the middle because it's the people in
the middle who did the actual work in the

62
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:09,007
world. My friend Dave would tell me about
catch up is a middle guy. He's worked on

63
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:13,081
catsup, that's how he knows about it.
People at the top are self-conscious about

64
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:18,023
what they say and rightfully so because
they have position and privilege to

65
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:22,082
protect and self-consciousness is the
enemy of interestingness. In The Pitchman

66
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:27,042
you'll meet Arnold Morris, who gave me the
pitch for the Dial-O-Matic vegetable

67
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:32,060
slicer one summer day in his kitchen on
the Jersey Shore. Come on over, folks. I'm

68
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:38,004
going to show you the most amazing slicing
machine you have ever seen in your life,

69
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:42,082
he began. He picked up a package of
barbecue spices and used it as a prop.

70
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:48,019
Take a look at this; he held it in the air
as if he were holding up a Tiffany vase.

71
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:52,077
That's where you find stories, in
someone's kitchen on the Jersey Shore.

72
00:06:54,072 --> 00:07:00,066
What makes a good question when you're
interviewing? Let's look an example and

73
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:06,075
you can decide whether you think this is a
good question. Our question is, is the

74
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:14,017
daily update an important feature to you?
My guess when asked a question like this

75
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:19,052
is that most users would say yes. It's
kind of a leading question. Most people

76
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:25,016
when asked to some things important, sure
why not. What's at stake, why would you

77
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:31,001
say n O? If you wanted to learn about the
daily update, or just an observation might

78
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:37,001
be a lot more effective because you could
see whether people actually use the daily

79
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:42,079
update or you might even use log files as
a way of driving your questions. So, for

80
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,043
example, you might ask somebody, I see
from the log that you have never used the

81
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:53,098
daily update, why is that? Tell me more,
Especially early on. The more open ended

82
00:07:53,098 --> 00:08:07,026
your questions are. The more interesting
answers that you'll get, Remember back to

83
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:12,003
our Walmart example, they asked the
leading question. Would you like stories

84
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:17,024
with less clutter? The answer of course is
yes but it may not be what people would

85
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:23,072
actually want. Here's another example of a
question. What would you like in a tool?

86
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:30,092
The problem with this question at least as
a beginning or primary question is that

87
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:37,017
users are experts in their own lives.
They're not experts in design, that's your

88
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:42,094
role so people may not know what to say.
There's a famous fable in design

89
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:49,003
attributed to Henry Ford where he says
that, if I ask people what they wanted,

90
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:55,045
and they [inaudible], what they had say
they want is a faster horse. And of course

91
00:08:55,045 --> 00:09:01,049
we know that the designers use the
possibility of the car but users may not

92
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:09,031
know about that yet. Instead, It's more
valuable to ask users about their own

93
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:16,091
lives and their own goals. That's what
people are expert in. Here are three other

94
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:23,022
types of questions to avoid because people
aren't very good at self report for them.

95
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:29,022
Asking people what they would do or like
or want in a hypothetical scenario, too

96
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:35,094
hard to know. Asking us how often we do
things. We often lie to ourselves. For

97
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:42,047
example, how often do you exercise? Most
people overestimating their answer to the

98
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:48,092
question, Other questions about how
they're similar, This works better if you

99
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:55,014
can make things concrete. How much do I
exercise in, in a typical week? Not very

100
00:09:55,014 --> 00:10:01,031
reliable, How much did I exercise this
week? Well, unlikely to give more truthful

101
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:07,033
answer to that one. It's more concrete,
and more recent in my memory. I suggest

102
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:13,082
also avoiding asking peopl e how much they
like things on an absolute scale. What is

103
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:19,097
seven mean. Finally avoid binary
questions, Things that have a yes or no

104
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:26,023
answer. Do you like grape fruit? Yes. Not
a very interesting interview so what are

105
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:32,018
good questions. Especially at the
beginning of an interview I recommend open

106
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:38,049
ended questions. After asking the
question, give somebody a chance to

107
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:49,018
respond. A little of silence is golden.
When I first try to teaching, I made a

108
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:54,090
mistake that a lot of young teachers make.
I would ask the class for a question and

109
00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:00,070
after seventeen milliseconds when nobody
had answered I would jump in and offer the

110
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,022
question myself. I trained the students
that they needed to be part of the class,

111
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:11,098
That I would always answer every question.
There is no reason to participate. One of

112
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:17,021
my colleagues taught me to wait a little
longer, And it's amazing even in quiet

113
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:22,037
classrooms before students are used to
interacting. Let a few seconds of silence

114
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:27,060
happen and people will start to try them
in. The same is true with interviews. You

115
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,032
may get a quick answer first. Let some
silence happen. After a few seconds,

116
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:36,084
you'll hear the second story. And the
second story is often a lot more
