1
00:00:02,031 --> 00:00:08,024
In addition to gaining insights from observing people,

2
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:13,029
it’s also valuable to interview them — ask them about their experiences directly.

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:20,029
The first step in setting up an interview is deciding who it is that you’re going to interview.

4
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:22,034
It may seem obvious

5
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:29,083
but the most important thing is to get people who are representative of the target users of your system —

6
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,091
who are the people who are going to be using your system.

7
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,048
Talk to them!

8
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:41,065
Now they may be current users of a similar system if you’re creating a better something,

9
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:47,013
you’ll likely find current users and you’ll want to learn what they care about,

10
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,023
what problems they see.

11
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:51,072
They might also be non-users.

12
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:56,057
So, one reason that you might be building your technology

13
00:00:56,057 --> 00:01:01,042
is to broaden the set of people that can do a certain task

14
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:04,076
and in that case you’ll want to talk to the non-users.

15
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:09,081
Learn about what barriers you see, learn about what their goals are.

16
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:13,076
Say, for example, you’re designing a lecture support system.

17
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:16,073
Who would you interview in this case?

18
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:23,037
There’s a lot of stakeholders: You might pick the teacher.

19
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:27,066
You might pick the students. You might also pick the teaching staff.

20
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:35,095
Maybe the department administrators that are responsible for making sure the grading is handled properly.

21
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,045
Maybe even the parents.

22
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:39,058
It’s important to get different types of users.

23
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:44,063
So, you might have both the freshman and a PhD student.

24
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:49,016
You might have a domestic student and an international student.

25
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:51,078
Somebody that’s in major and out of major.

26
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,096
Stronger and weaker students.

27
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:57,004
There are a lot of different kinds of users.

28
00:01:57,004 --> 00:02:02,092
You can’t get them all, but you’ll want to find several different people

29
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:07,062
who are representative of major user groups, and talk to them.

30
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,068
How can you find these people?

31
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:17,035
Well, one great strategy, if you’re in the US, is to use Craigslist.

32
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,052
You can also reach out through friends and family.

33
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:24,055
Your social network is a powerful tool for finding people to interview.

34
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:30,038
That doesn’t just mean or even primarily mean “interview your sister”;

35
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:33,056
it means “ask your sister whom she might know”

36
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:39,002
or “ask your friend to put you in touch with people they might know.”

37
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:42,054
It’s quite likely that you’ll need to pay people.

38
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,055
In the Bay Area, on Craigslist,

39
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:51,047
somewhere in the land of 50 to 100 bucks for an interview seems to be the going rate.

40
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:57,008
This gets cheaper if you can have less specialized users.

41
00:02:57,008 --> 00:03:03,035
Also, the amount that you’ll need to pay people depends on what they believe is going to be used for.

42
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:07,036
If you can convey that in some way you’re making the world a better place,

43
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:11,072
people may be willing to offer their time for free, even.

44
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:15,071
On the other hand, if they believe that something will be used for a profit,

45
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:19,071
they’ll likely want a fair wage for their time.

46
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:25,048
If you’re a skunkworks project and don’t have enough money to really pay people,

47
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,041
one thing that you can do is offer a token of appreciation.

48
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:36,053
People often appreciate a small thoughtful gift that they can actually use, like a gift certificate or some sort,

49
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,093
than they do cash.

50
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:42,054
For example, a couple of years ago I’ve spoken at a local high school

51
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:47,015
and the students gave me a gift certificate to a coffee shop.

52
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:53,038
Now, the amount of money there was not much; but I meant that every time I travelled,

53
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:56,066
I could go in the coffee shop in the airport and get a cup of coffee

54
00:03:56,068 --> 00:04:01,015
and it reminded me of that group of students and their thoughtfulness.

55
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:08,076
Sometimes, especially early on the design project,

56
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:15,054
it can be difficult to get a hold of exactly the users that you believe will eventually be the target.

57
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:20,005
In this case don’t give up completely and interview nobody.

58
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:24,095
Do the best you can; approximate if necessary.

59
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:28,059
For example, if you are designing a system for doctors,

60
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:36,083
early on the project, you might need to sacrifice and use medical students instead of doctors.

61
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:42,078
Or if you are working on something for software engineers, you might get computer science students.

62
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:46,067
Not ideal; better than nothing.

63
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:54,097
I’ve been teaching and doing research in human-computer interaction for about 15 years now

64
00:04:54,097 --> 00:05:05,027
and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve talked to students or others who say that there’s nothing to be found,

65
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:11,074
that, for the problem that they’re tackling, it’s either possible or obvious.

66
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:14,071
It’s very rarely the case that there is nothing new.

67
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:18,081
The more mundane the domain, the more creative you need to be.

68
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:22,002
If you don’t believe me, Malcolm Gladwell the writer

69
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:28,093
has a wonderful explanation in the introduction to his new book of collective stories « What the Dog [Saw] ».

70
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:35,059
“The trick to finding ideas is to convince yourself that everyone and everything has a story to tell.

71
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:40,090
I say trick, but what I really mean is challenge, because it’s a very hard thing to do.

72
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,010
Shampoo doesn’t seem interesting? Well, dammit, it must be, and if it isn’t,

73
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,089
I have to believe that it will ultimately lead me [to something] that is.”

74
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:54,050
“The other trick to finding ideas is figuring out the difference between power and knowledge.

75
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,021
You don’t start at the top if you want to find the story.

76
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:04,020
You start in the middle, because it’s the people in the middle who do the actual work in the world.

77
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,071
My friend Dave, who taught me about ketchup, is a middle guy.

78
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:11,012
He’s worked on ketchup. That’s how he knows about it.

79
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:15,073
People at the top are self-conscious about what they say (and rightfully so)

80
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:18,058
because they have position and privilege to protect —

81
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:22,054
and self consciousness is the enemy of ‘interestingness.’”

82
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:25,066
“In ‘The Pitchman’ you’ll meet Arnold Morris, who gave me the pitch

83
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:30,060
for the ‘Dial-O-Matic’ vegetable slicer one summer day in his kitchen on the Jersey Shore:

84
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,077
‘Come on over, folks.

85
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:36,088
I’m going to show you the most amazing slicing machine you have ever seen in your life,’ he began.

86
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:42,064
He picked up a package of barbecue spices and used it as a prop.

87
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:48,030
‘Take a look at this!’ He held it in the air as if he were holding up a Tiffany vase.

88
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,007
That’s where you find stories, in someone’s kitchen on the Jersey Shore.”

89
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,000
What makes a good question when you’re interviewing?

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,048
Let’s look an example and you can decide whether you think this is a good question.

91
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:11,076
Our question is: “Is the daily update an important feature to you?”

92
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:16,060
My guess when asked a question like this is that most users would say “Yes.”

93
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,096
It’s kind of a leading question.

94
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:22,061
Most people, when asked if something’s important, “Sure, why not?”

95
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:24,059
What’s at stake? Why would you say no?

96
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:30,082
If you wanted to learn about the daily update, participant observation might be a lot more effective

97
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:35,089
because you could see whether people actually use the daily update

98
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:39,067
or you might even use log files as a way of driving your questions.

99
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:48,042
So, for example, you might ask somebody, “I see from the log that you’ve never used the daily update.

100
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,076
Why is that? Tell me more.”

101
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:58,023
Especially early on, the more open-ended your questions are, the more interesting the answers that you’ll get.

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,078
Remember — back to our Walmart example — they asked a leading question:

103
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:13,038
“Would you like stories with less clutter?”

104
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,017
The answer, of course, is “yes”, but it may not be what people would actually want.

105
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:24,034
Here’s another example of a question: “What would you like in a tool?”

106
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:29,098
The problem with this question, at least as a beginning or primary question,

107
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,052
is that users are experts in their own lives.

108
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:40,081
They’re not experts in design — that’s your role — so people may not know what to say.

109
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:45,029
There’s a famous fable in design attributed to Henry Ford where he says that,

110
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,073
“if I asked people what they wanted in the age of the horse and buggy,

111
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:54,018
what they’d say they want is a faster horse.”

112
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:58,086
And of course we know that the designers used the possibility of the car,

113
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:03,054
but users may not know about that yet.

114
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:11,011
Instead, it’s more valuable to ask users about their own lives and their own goals.

115
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,000
That’s what people are experts in.

116
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:22,092
Here are three other types of questions to avoid because people aren’t very good at self report for them;

117
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:29,081
Asking people what they would do or like or want in a hypothetical scenario — too hard to know.

118
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:36,044
Asking us how often we do things — We often lie to ourselves.

119
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:42,086
For example, “How often do you exercise?” Most people overestimate in their answer to that question.

120
00:09:44,024 --> 00:09:50,060
Other questions about how are things similar. This works better if you can make things concrete.

121
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:56,069
“How much do I exercise in a typical week?” — Not very reliable.

122
00:09:56,069 --> 00:10:02,073
“How much did I exercise this week?” Well, I’m likely to give more truthful answer to that one.

123
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:06,086
It’s more concrete, and more recent in my memory.

124
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:11,080
I suggest also avoiding asking people how much they like things on an absolute scale:

125
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,027
What does “seven” mean?

126
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:20,011
Finally, avoid binary questions, things that have a yes or no answer.

127
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:24,093
“Do you like grapefruit?” – “Yes.” Not a very interesting interview.

128
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,023
So what are good questions?

129
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:33,097
Especially at the beginning of an interview, I recommend open-ended questions.

130
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:38,076
After asking the question, give somebody a chance to respond.

131
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:42,035
A little bit of silence is golden.

132
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:52,063
When I first started teaching, I made a mistake that a lot of young teachers make:

133
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:58,051
I would ask the class for a question, and after 17 milliseconds, when nobody had answered,

134
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:01,040
I would jump in and offer the question myself.

135
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:09,001
I trained the students that they didn’t need to be part of the class, that I would always answer every question.

136
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,065
There is no reason to participate.

137
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:14,073
One of my colleagues taught me to wait a little longer.

138
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:20,022
And it’s amazing, even in a quiet classroom, before students are used to interacting,

139
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:23,089
let those few seconds of silence happen and people will start to chime in.

140
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:26,043
The same is true in interviews.

141
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:31,041
You may get a quick answer at first. Let some silence happen.

142
00:11:31,041 --> 99:59:59,000
After a few seconds, you’ll hear the second story. And the second story is often a lot more interesting.
