1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,087
In my opinion, the single most important idea that you could get out of this class

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:10,042
is the idea that prototyping is a tremendously valuable strategy for effective design.

3
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:15,023
In this video, I’ll introduce what I mean by prototyping and why I think it is so tremendously important.

4
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:20,026
This is going to serve as a framing for later videos that we’ll use to introduce concrete techniques.

5
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:24,055
In this class, when we talk about prototyping, what we mean is

6
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:29,085
rapidly creating an approximation of a design idea so that you can quickly get feedback and learn.

7
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:35,024
Prototyping is the pivotal activity in structured  innovation, collaboration and creativity in design.

8
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:39,001
Prototypes embody design hypotheses and enable designers to get feedback.

9
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,073
It’s what Donald Schon calls “a reflective conversation with materials”.

10
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:48,002
By trying things out and learning — from that exploration — you are able to improve your design

11
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:52,014
and be able to gain insights that you otherwise may not have.

12
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:57,008
It’s important to remember that the goal in prototyping is not the artefact; it’s feedback:

13
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:02,004
Build some prototypes, try them out, and usually you’d learn to try to in the next design.

14
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:06,004
One way to think about a prototype is that it’s a question rendered as an artefact.

15
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:11,024
It’s something that you make as a way of communicating with other stakeholders:

16
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:15,070
These can be clients. These can be other people on your design team.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,086
These can be users in an interactive system. They can even be yourself.

18
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:25,016
And the role of the prototype in this communication is it serves as a common ground

19
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:29,071
to help people understand really concretely what everybody is talking about.

20
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:33,089
Here’s an example of what I mean by a prototype, courtesy of the design firm IDEO:

21
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:41,015
In the mid-90’s, Kodak approached IDEO, asking them to help design an early consumer digital camera.

22
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:44,018
Digital cameras were a very interesting technology,

23
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:49,062
because they offered new opportunities for being able to review and edit your photos on the camera

24
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:51,065
that wasn’t possible with the film camera.

25
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:57,025
IDEO was tasked with a way to make sense of possible interactions that you could do on a digital camera

26
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:01,014
and to render those on a concrete user interface.

27
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:06,068
What they came up with ultimately became this: the Kodak DC-210 digital camera.

28
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:09,026
Here’s the user interface on the back:

29
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:13,034
There’s a screen and several buttons for being able to naigate through the photographs.

30
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:18,095
It also has a dial here for several modes, and a zoom controller right here.

31
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:21,057
Now let’s look at the prototype on the screen:

32
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:25,013
You’ll probably notice some similarities but also some differences.

33
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:29,068
The prototype on the screen and the final product both have buttons.

34
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:34,018
They have a screen. They are of similar functionalities in this case.

35
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:39,093
However, there’re also some important differences between this prototype and this final version.

36
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,088
The first one is that the prototype is a lot bigger:

37
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:45,097
In order to be able to build a version quickly, they couldn’t make everything miniturized.

38
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:51,050
So it takes more a lot more physical space; the layout is similar but the scale has changed.

39
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:56,051
Second, one of the most important things about a digital camera is that you be able to take it with you as it is mobile;

40
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:01,043
This prototype camera here had an umbilical cord going back to a Macintosh

41
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:04,057
that actually ran all of the computations and interactions,

42
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,073
so there were no computation on the device itself.

43
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:12,062
And finally, this was a prototype of a digital camera where you couldn’t take pictures.

44
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:16,047
There’s no lens; there’s no photographic elements in this prototype;

45
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:23,003
it’s purely a way to understand better the back of camera interactions for reviewing and editing photos.

46
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,000
And I think this is a really important point about prototypes:

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,071
It’s that prototypes nearly always are and ought to be incomplete.

48
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:35,004
To pop back up from that example:

49
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:40,012
Prototyping is a strategy for efficiently dealing with things that are hard to predict.

50
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,014
And these hard-to-predict things are both

51
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:49,007
things that you wonder whether there’ll be an issue but don’t know what the answers’s going to be — your “known unknowns —

52
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:54,086
and the things that you don’t know, that you never got to think about — those are your “unknown unknowns”.

53
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:58,082
And what’s valuable about prototyping is it helps you to get feedback quickly,

54
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:01,084
so you don’t spend time heading down the wrong path.

55
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:06,089
If you’ve ever taken an art class, you’ll know the experience of sketching before you make a painting.

56
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:09,093
It’s not just for novices: Picasso did the same thing.

57
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:14,065
One of the things that we know about human psychology is that

58
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:18,030
people are notoriously bad at being able to estimate the space of possible outcomes.

59
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,057
We often consider far fewer options than are actually likely to happen.

60
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:26,059
And this is just as true in the financial world as it is in the creative world.

61
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:32,036
For any complex system, whether it is finance or design, the interactions of all these ingredients

62
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:38,037
far dominate the things that you can easily predict, and consequently our intuitions are often wrong.

63
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:42,041
The strategy that we are going to teach you in this class is to encourage you to focus on

64
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:47,038
the goals of the design rather than to think about a particular design itself

65
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,090
and trying to railroad that strategy forward.

66
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,024
A classic novice error is to come up with one idea for a design:

67
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:59,053
You think you’ve got something that’s super cool and just keep arguing for that particular option.

68
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:02,080
Instead of having that concrete thing you want to argue for,

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,050
think about what you hope to achieve with that design idea — what’s your goal there.

70
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:14,063
In this class we’re going to teach how to set goals early and evolve them and revise your design using data.

71
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:19,011
As Bill Buxton points out in his excellent book « Sketching User Interfaces »,

72
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:23,028
the kinds of alternatives that you’re going to consider at different points of the design process

73
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:25,015
are going to be different.

74
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:30,000
Early on, you may be thinking about a really broad range of possibilities.

75
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:33,077
And then you might narrow in for a little while.

76
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:36,060
Then you might consider some alternatives and narrow in.

77
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,099
And this alternating flair and focus is a hallmark of an effective design process.

78
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:45,049
Later on in the design, as you get toward the final product,

79
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:51,014
you’re  going to be thinking about  small variations like fonts or colours or micro changes in layout.

80
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:54,052
Early on you might be thinking about much broader ideas like:

81
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,082
Is this going to be a mobile service or a desktop service?

82
00:05:57,082 --> 00:06:01,016
And what kind of thing is this going to be anyhow?

83
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:08,013
Recognizing the need for and value of this oscillation can help you prepare for an effective design process.

84
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:13,035
The Palm Pilot’s design process provides us with a wonderful example of prototyping.

85
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:18,071
The Palm Pilot was one of the first digital PDA’s — personal digital assistants —

86
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:24,004
and it helped you handle your to-do lists, and calendar, and contact information and notes.

87
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:30,056
Its lead inventor was Jeff Hawkins; and Jeff, when he first envisioned the Palm Pilot,

88
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:37,011
one of the first things that he did was create a block of wood that was the size of the device that he envisioned.

89
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:42,067
And what he would do is carry this block of wood around with him and he would use it as if it were a real device:

90
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:48,047
So he would tap on it and enter information, add contacts, record things in his calendar,

91
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:53,022
take notes, furiously scribbling the whole time.

92
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:56,058
So what did Jeff and his team learn from this prototype?

93
00:06:56,058 --> 00:07:01,087
Well, they obviously didn’t learn anything about the silicone or the battery life or anything of the Palm Pilot

94
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,003
because the whole thing was made out of wood!

95
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:08,011
What they learned was about the form factor, and what we can see here

96
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:14,019
is that this was a great example of the rights and roles that a prototype can play in the design process.

97
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:20,010
A prototype should not be required to be complete; it’s going to be incomplete in strategic and important ways.

98
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:26,026
It should be easy to change — Don’t like the size of your Palm Pilot? Just cut it off a different size!

99
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:28,068
And finally, it should get to retire:

100
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:34,070
That, when you move on to a later phase in the design process, you no longer need the early prototypes.

101
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:39,080
Given that we are in a class about designing computer systems and we’re talking about a block of wood,

102
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,028
you might reasonably ask, “What’s going on here?” or maybe, “What is it that prototypes prototype?”

103
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:50,052
And the answer is that there are several things that a prototype can prototype.

104
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:56,026
One kind of prototype prototypes the feel — “What does this look like?”

105
00:07:56,026 --> 00:08:01,039
Another kind prototypes the implementation — “What might this work like?”

106
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,001
And yet another kind of prototype prototypes the role —

107
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,063
“What might the experience of using this interactive system be like?”

108
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:12,096
This course will teach you a number of strategies that cover a bit of each of these categories.

109
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:15,060
You can plot a prototype in two dimensions.

110
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,064
You can think about how much you’ll learn from that prototype,

111
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,038
and you can think about how long it took you to create it.

112
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,046
And what you want to able to do, especially early on in the design process,

113
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:28,063
is to be able to maximize the amount of learning that you are being able to get from  that prototype,

114
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:31,071
and minimize the amount of time that it is going to take you to create it,

115
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,066
because — remember — a prototype is going to be incomplete,

116
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:39,048
and it’s going to be something that you are going to get rid of most likely at some point in the process,

117
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:44,024
and so there’s no point in sinking a lot of time into something that you’re soon going to throw away.

118
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:50,047
Prototyping is not just for small things. In your prototyping you can think big — really big.

119
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:54,015
Here’s an example from Walter Dorwin Teague, this guy right here.

120
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:58,034
He is one of America’s foremost industrial designers.

121
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:03,037
And he is standing inside of one of the very first Boeing cross-country airplanes.

122
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:09,059
And what he’s doing is taking a look at the interior design that his company did for Boeing,

123
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,090
(and they still work with Boeing to this day).

124
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,074
What’s notable here is that you’ve got an interior of an aircraft, but there’s no aircraft!

125
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:25,017
This is all mocked up in a warehouse. It’s the experience of an airplane without the airplane.

126
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:30,087
In creating this prototype, they brought in a number of users, and had people come on with luggage

127
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:36,089
and try out the experience of the airplane, where they would sit down, take their seats for the length

128
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:42,012
of a cross-country flight, and flight attendants would come through to offer them food and other amenities,

129
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:45,015
and you could see things like “Are the aisles wide enough?”,

130
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:50,066
“Are the seats comfortable?”, “Will the luggage racks carry the luggage that’s necessary?”

131
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:55,042
Walter Teague wasn’t the only industrial designer to be able to use these large prototypes of scale.

132
00:09:55,042 --> 00:10:00,079
Many of the designers creating ocean-going vessels tried the same strategy

133
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:07,061
of prototyping interiors in warehouses, and in fact as Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs  reports,

134
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:13,034
when Apple was creating its first retail stores, they got some warehouse space outside of San Jose,

135
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:19,090
and every week went to a fake retail store to try out the retail experience in advance of first opening,

136
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:25,067
and one of the things that that biography reports about the retail experience at Apple was,

137
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:32,002
by the virtue of prototyping it and trying out different configurations of the store, the Apple team realized

138
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:39,029
that the stores can be configured around activities — such as music — rather than around individual products,

139
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:43,082
and this significantly changed the layout of the Apple Stores prior to their opening.

140
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:48,067
Linus Pauling may be the premier chemist in the 20th century.

141
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:53,013
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on describing the nature of chemical bonds.

142
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:56,090
What his work philosophy shares with that of professional designers

143
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:02,071
is the practice of trying out multiple alternative ideas, approaches, and solution strategies.

144
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:06,080
As he says here, “The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas.”

145
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:12,066
And we see that here in a hundred different prototypes that the design firm IDEO produced for Microsoft

146
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:15,049
when it was creating its first mouse.

147
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:21,005
There are a number of form alternatives that it explored — symmetric versus assymetric designs,

148
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:25,024
ones that emphasize ergonomics versus others that emphasize style —

149
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:29,016
and being able to see all of these alternatives and hold them in one’s hand

150
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:33,085
helped Microsoft figure out which design was the best fit for it to release the mouse with.

151
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:39,091
For the geeks in the audience: You can think about this kind of rapid prototyping strategy that we’re talking about

152
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:45,018
as being kind of like simulated annealing, where you have a space of possible options,

153
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:53,068
some of them better than the others, and what often happens with serial iterative deisgn

154
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:56,080
is that you can hillclimb to the best one.

155
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,090
But local improvement isn’t enough:

156
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:04,038
You need to be able to hop around the design space and try wildly different  alternatives.

157
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:07,032
That way you can find the global maximum.

158
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:12,054
When you’re creating a prototyping strategy, it’s important to think about the cost of change over time.

159
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:18,081
For physical products —— like a car, a toaster —, the cost of making changes rises dramatically over time

160
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:23,039
throughout the design process, and even more significantly upon release.

161
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:30,031
With desktop software that gets distributed on, say, a CDROM, the cost rises aren’t quite so dramatic,

162
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:35,065
but it’s still pretty significant, harder to make changes as you go throughout the design process,

163
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:39,009
and much more difficult once you’ve shipped it out to consumers.

164
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,032
Web sites, and other forms of software as a service, make it much easier to make changes over time.

165
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:55,026
But the costs and difficulty of making changes is still increasing for a number of reasons.

166
00:12:55,026 --> 00:13:00,063
One of the most important is that people get used to a particular piece of software over time.

167
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:05,072
And so even if you could change it easily, you’d upset and confuse a significant user base.

168
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:11,072
The same is true for developers [of] any software that has API’s that people are writing applications on top of.

169
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:16,066
Once people get used to it, or have built things that rely on a piece of software,

170
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:19,019
it becomes more difficult to change.

171
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,050
Altogether, what this means is that you want to create a design process

172
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,043
where you’re making your biggest changes early,

173
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:31,041
and as you build momentum with users, you’re continuing to refine,

174
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:34,077
and adapt, and tweak, and improve your system as it goes on.

175
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,007
I think I can sum up the introductory message of this framing video in one sentence:

176
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:47,018
It’s that “prototypes are questions; ask lots of them.”

177
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:50,055
We’ll see you next time.
