I really like this example
because it illustrates the kind of experiments
that you can easily do on your own.
And it also shows how, in this case,
by making the imperative vocabulary stronger —
“Follow me,” or even “You should follow me” —
we see an increase in clickthrough rate.
The clearer you make what users ought to do,
the more users click through.
