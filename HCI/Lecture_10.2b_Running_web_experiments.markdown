I really like this example
because it illustrates the kind of experiments
that you can easily do on your own.
And it also shows how, in this case,
by making the imperative vocabulary stronger —
“Follow me,” or even “You should follow me” —
we see an increase in clickthrough rate:
The clearer you make what users ought to do,
the more users click through.

Ron Kohavi has been a leading expert
for controlled experimentation for a number of years,
and I’d like to share with you a couple of examples from his research.
He’s currently at Microsoft,
and here’s a simple example from search results
that shows how imperceptible changes to an individual
can aggregate to yield phenomena that you can measure.

Here you can see two versions of search results,
one which is slightly typographically crisper than the other one —
you may not even notice the difference at all.
However, this difference, which is below your conscious level,
increases the number of query per user by 0.9%
and the number of ad clicks per user increases 3%.
At the scale that Microsoft and the other large search [carriers] operate,
this is a *huge* change.
And I think this is a nice example of how, in general,
the giant scale of experiments that you can conduct on the web
makes small but consequential differences detectable —
things which we’d never see in the lab
you can now investigate.
Also, it’s an example of how changes which are too small to matter
for a couple of people —
if you are building search results for 10 users,
a 0.9% change might not be something you’d
