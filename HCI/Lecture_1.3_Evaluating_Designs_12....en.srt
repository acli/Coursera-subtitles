1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:06,008
In many ways, the most creative, challenging, and under-appreciated aspect of interaction design

2
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,046
is evaluating designs with people.

3
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:11,056
The insights that you’ll get from testing designs with people

4
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:16,001
can help you get new ideas, make changes, decide wisely, and fix bugs.

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:20,081
One reason I think design is such an interesting field is its relationship to truth and objectivity.

6
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:26,040
I find design so incredibly fascinating because we can say more in response to a question like:

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,096
“How can we measure success?” than “It’s just personal preference” or “Whatever feels right.”

8
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:37,047
At the same time, the answers are more complex and more open-ended, more subjective,

9
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:41,054
and require more wisdom than just a number like 7 or 3.

10
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,084
One of the things that we’re going to learn in this class

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:48,037
is the different kinds of knowledge that you can get out of different kinds of methods.

12
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:53,031
Why evaluate designs with people? Why learn about how people use interactive systems?

13
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:58,044
I think one major reason for this is that it can be difficult to tell how good a user interface is

14
00:00:58,044 --> 00:01:03,097
until you’ve tried it out with actual users, and that’s because clients and designers and developers,

15
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:07,010
they may know too much about the domain and the user interface,

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,037
or have acquired blinders through designing and building the user interface.

17
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:15,041
At the same time they may not know enough about the user’s actual tasks.

18
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:20,096
And while experience and theory can help, it can still be hard to predict what real users will actually do.

19
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:25,000
You might want to know, “Can people figure out how to use it?”

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,085
or “Do they swear or giggle when using this interface?”

21
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:31,022
“How does this design compare to that design?”

22
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:35,033
and, “If we changed the interface, how does that change people’s behaviour?”

23
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:39,049
“What new practices might emerge?” “How do things change over time?”

24
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:44,071
These are all great questions to ask about an interface, and each will come from different methods.

25
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:49,093
The value of having a broad toolbox of different methods can be especially valuable in emerging areas

26
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:56,017
like mobile and social software where people’s use practices can be particularly context-dependent

27
00:01:56,017 --> 00:02:00,068
and also evolves significantly over time in response to how other people use software

28
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:03,019
through network effects and things like that.

29
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:08,053
To give you a flavour of this, I’d like to quickly run through some common types of empiracal research in HCI.

30
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:14,002
The examples I’ll show are mostly published work of one sort or another, because that’s the easiest stuff to share.

31
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:18,065
If you have good examples from current systems out in the world, post them to the forum!

32
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:21,012
I keep an archive of user interface examples,

33
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:24,043
and I and the other students would love to see what you can come up with.

34
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,017
One way to learn about the user experience of a design

35
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:30,081
is to bring people into your lab or office and have them try it out.

36
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:32,097
We often call these usability studies.

37
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:37,045
This “watch someone use my interface” approach is a common one in HCI.

38
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:43,062
This basic strategy for traditional user-centred design is to iteratively bring people

39
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:48,022
into your lab or office until you run out of time. And then release.

40
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:52,031
And, if you had deep pockets, these rooms had a one-way glass mirror,

41
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:54,068
and the development team was on the other side.

42
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:59,024
In a leaner environment, this may be just bring in people into your dorm room orffice.

43
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:01,067
You’ll learn a huge amount by doing this.

44
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:07,073
Every single time that I or a student, friend, or colleague has watched somebody use a new interactive system,

45
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:14,018
we learn something, [as,] as designers we get blinders to systems’ quirks, bugs, and false assumptions.

46
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,056
However, there are some major shortcomings to this approach.

47
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:24,012
In particular, the setting probably isn’t very ecologically valid.

48
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:29,046
In the real world, people may have different tasks, goals, motivations, and physical settings

49
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:32,028
than your office or lab.

50
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:35,035
This can be especially true for user interfaces that you think people might  use on the go,

51
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:38,040
like at a bus stop or while waiting in line.

52
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,082
Second, there can be a “please me” experimental bias,

53
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:44,012
where  when you bring somebody in to try out a user interface,

54
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:47,033
they know that they’re trying out the technology that you developed

55
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:54,059
and so they may work harder or be nicer than they would if they had to use it without the constraints of a lab setup

56
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:58,049
with the person who developed it watching right over them.

57
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,033
Third, in its most basic form where you’re just trying out just one  user interface, there is no comparison point.

58
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:09,017
So while you can track when people laugh, or swear, or smile with joy,

59
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:12,045
you won’t know whether they would’ve laugh more, or sworn less, or smiled more

60
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,097
if you’d had a different user interface.

61
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:18,017
And finally it requires bringing people to your physical location.

62
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:20,059
This is often a whole lot easier than a lot of people think.

63
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,084
It can be a psychological burden, even if nothing else.

64
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,017
A very different way of getting feedback from people is to use a survey.

65
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:34,012
Here is an example of a survey that I got recently from San Francisco asking about different street light designs.

66
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:38,015
Surveys are great because you can quickly get feedback from a large number of responses.

67
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,035
And it’s relatively easy to compare multiple alternatives.

68
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:44,038
You can also automatically tally the results.

69
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,038
You don’t even need to build anything; you can just show screen shots or mock-ups.

70
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,053
One of the things that I’ve learned the hard way, though,

71
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:55,014
is the difference between what people say they’re going to do and what they actually do.

72
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:59,002
Ask people how often they exercise and you’ll probably get a much more optimistic answer

73
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:02,005
than how often they really do exercise.

74
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:05,017
The same holds for the street light example here.

75
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:08,099
Try to imagine what a number of different street light designs might be

76
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:15,038
is really different than actually observing them on the street and having them become part of normal everyday life.

77
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,008
Still, it can be valuable to get feedback.

78
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:20,043
Another type of responder strategy is focus groups.

79
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:26,004
In a focus group, you’ll gather together a small group of people to discuss a design or idea.

80
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:31,037
The fact that focus groups involve a group of people is a double-edged sword.

81
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:37,054
On one hand, you can get people to tease out of their colleagues things that they might not have thought

82
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:44,057
to say on their own; on the other hand, for a variety of psychological reasons, people may be inclined

83
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:48,077
to say polite things or generate answers completely on the spot

84
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:53,078
that are totally uncorrelated with what they believe or what they would actually do.

85
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:59,098
Focus groups can be a particularly problematic method when you are looking at trying to gather data

86
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:04,013
about taboo topics or about cultural biases.

87
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:06,072
With those caveats — right now we’re just making a laundry list, and —

88
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:12,031
I think that focus groups, like almost any  other method, can play an important role in your toolbelt.

89
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,057
Our third category of techniques is to get feedback from experts.

90
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:22,090
For example, in this class we’re going to do  a bunch of peer critique for your weekly project assignments.

91
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,036
In addition to having users try your interface,

92
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:29,077
it can be important to eat your own dog food and use the tools that you built yourself.

93
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:35,006
When you are getting feedback from experts, it can often be helpful to have some kind of structured format,

94
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:38,055
much like the rubrics you’ll see in your project assignments.

95
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:44,088
And, for getting feedback on user interfaces, one common approach to this  structured feedback

96
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:48,038
is called heuristic evaluation, and you’ll learn how to do that in this class;

97
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:51,005
it’s pioneered by Jacob Nielson.

98
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:53,049
Our next genre is comparative experiments:

99
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:57,056
taking two or more distinct options and comparing their performance to each other.

100
00:06:57,056 --> 00:07:00,018
These comparisons can take place in lots of different ways:

101
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:04,006
They can be in the lab; they can be in the field; they can be online.

102
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,054
These experiments can be more-or-less controlled,

103
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:10,012
and they can take place over shorter or longer durations.

104
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:15,065
What you’re trying to learn here is which option is the more effective, and, more often,

105
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:21,042
what are the active ingredients, what are the variables that matter in creating the user experience that you seek.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,071
Here’s an example: My former PhD student Joel Brandt, and his colleague at Adobe,

107
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,084
ran a number of studies comparing help interfaces for programmers.

108
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:38,031
In particular they compared a more traditional search-style user interface for finding programming help

109
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:43,044
with a search interface that integrated programming help directly into your environment.

110
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:46,097
By running these comparisons they were able to see how programmers’ behaviour differed

111
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:50,058
based on the changing help user interface.

112
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:53,069
Comparative experiments have an advantage over surveys

113
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:57,023
in that you get to see the actual behaviour as opposed to self report,

114
00:07:57,023 --> 00:08:02,032
and they can be better than usability studies because you’re comparing multiple alternatives.

115
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:06,078
This enables you to see what works better or worse, or at least what works different.

116
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:10,036
I find that comparative feedback is also often much more actionable.

117
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:13,093
However, if you are running controlled experiments online,

118
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:18,007
you don’t get to see much about the person on the other side of the screen.

119
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:20,077
And if you are inviting people into your office or lab,

120
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:24,011
the behaviour you’re measuring might not be very realistic.

121
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:30,028
If realistic longitudinal behaviour is what you’re after, participant observation may be the approach for you.

122
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:36,041
This approach is just what it sounds like: observing what people actually do in their actual work environment.

123
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:40,022
And this more long-term evaluation can be important for uncovering things

124
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:44,013
that you might not see in shorter term, more controlled scenarios.

125
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:48,001
For example, my colleagues Bob Sutton and Andrew Hargadon studied brainstorming.

126
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:54,040
The prior literature on brainstorming had focused mostly on questions like “Do people come up with more ideas?”

127
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,051
What Bob and Andrew realized by going into the field was that brainstorming served a number of other functions also,

128
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:05,036
like, for example, brainstorming provides a way for members of the design team

129
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:08,008
to demonstrate their creativity to their peers;

130
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:13,021
it allows them to pass along knowledge that then can be reused in other projects;

131
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:19,005
and it creates a fun, exciting environment that people like to work in and that clients like to participate in.

132
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:22,020
In a real ecosystem, all of these things are important,

133
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,051
in addition to just having the ideas that people come up with.

134
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:32,090
Nearly all experiments seek to build a theory on some level — I don’t mean anything fancy by this,

135
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,030
just that we take some things to be more relevant, and other things less relevant.

136
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:43,006
We might, for example, assume that the ordering of search results may play an important role in what people click on,

137
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:49,076
but that the batting average of the Detroit Tigers doesn’t, unless, of course, somebody’s searching for baseball.

138
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:55,009
If you have a theory that sufficiently, formal mathematically that you may make predictions,

139
00:09:55,009 --> 00:10:00,003
then you can compare alternative interfaces using that model, without having to bring people in.

140
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:05,057
And we’ll go over that in this class a little bit, with respect to input models.

141
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:10,007
This makes it possible to try out a number of alternatives really fast.

142
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:16,037
Consequently, when people use simulations it’s often in conjunction with something like Monte Carlo optimization.

143
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:19,093
One example of this can be found in the ShapeWriter system,

144
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:22,073
where Shuman Zhai and colleagues figured out how to build a keyboard

145
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:26,012
where people could enter an entire word in a single stroke.

146
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:31,024
They were able to do this with the benefit of formal models and optimization-based approaches.

147
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:34,040
Simulation has mostly been used for input techniques

148
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,079
because people’s motor performance is probably the most well-quantified area of HCI.

149
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,070
And, while we won’t get much to it in this intro course,

150
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,026
simulation can also be used for higher-level cognitive tasks;

151
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:51,052
for example, Pete Pirolli and colleagues at PARC had built impressive models of people’s web-searching behaviour.

152
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:57,025
These models enable them to estimate, for example, which links somebody is most likely to click on

153
00:10:57,025 --> 00:11:00,023
by looking at the relevant link texts.

154
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:05,007
That’s our whirlwind tour of a number of empirical methods that this class will introduce.

155
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:09,048
You’ll want to pick the right method for the right task, and here’s some issues to consider:

156
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:13,018
If you did it again, would you get the same thing?

157
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:18,054
Another is generalizability and realism — Does this hold for people other than 18-year-old

158
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:23,013
upper-middle-class students who are doing this for course credit or a gift certificate?

159
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:28,054
Is this behaviour also what you’d see in the real world, or only in a more stilted lab environment?

160
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,086
Comparisons are important, because they can tell you

161
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:34,035
how the user experience would change with different interface choices,

162
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:38,055
as opposed to just a “people liked it” study.

163
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:42,078
It’s also important to think about how to achieve how these insights efficiently,

164
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:48,074
and not chew up a lot of resources, especially when your goal is practical.

165
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:54,025
My experience as a designer, researcher, teacher, consultant, advisor and mentor has taught me

166
00:11:54,025 --> 00:12:01,033
that evaluating designs with people is both easier and more valuable than many people expect,

167
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,070
and there’s an incredible lightbulb moment that happens

168
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,083
when you actually get designs in front of people and see how they use them.

169
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:12,094
So, to sum up this video, I’d like to ask what could be the most important question:

170
00:12:12,094 --> 99:59:59,000
“What do you want to learn?”
