00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,007
In this lecture, we're gonna talk about
trying out your interface with people, and

2
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:11,002
doing so in a way that you can improve
your designs based on what you learned.

3
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:15,091
One of the most common things that people
ask when running studies is, do you like

4
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:19,067
my interface? And it's a really natural
thing to ask because on some level it's

5
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:23,048
what we all want to know. But this is
really problematic on a whole lot of

6
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:28,004
levels. For one it's not very specific and
so sometimes people will try and make this

7
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:32,006
better and so they'll, they'll improve it
by doing something like how much do you

8
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:37,000
like my interface on a one to five scale?
Or this is a useful interface. Agree or

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,005
disagree on a one to five scale? And this
adds some kind of patina of scientificness

10
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:45,046
to it but really its just the same thing
you're asking somebody. Do you like my

11
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:49,066
interface? And people are nice so they're
going to say, sure I like your interface.

12
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:54,042
This is the please the experimenter bias.
And this can be especially strong when

13
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:58,052
there are social or cultural or power
differences between the experimenter and

14
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:02,086
the people that you are trying out your
interface with. For example [inaudible]

15
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:08,001
and colleagues showed these in effect in
India, where this effect was exacerbated

16
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:12,005
when the examiner was white. Now you
should not take this to mean that you

17
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:17,002
shouldn't have your developers try out
stuff with users. Being the person who is

18
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:22,000
both the developer and the person who is
trying stuff out is incredibly valuable.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,065
And one example I like a lot of this is by
Mike Krieger, one of the Instagram

20
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:30,009
founders is also a former master student
and TA of mine. And Mike, when he left

21
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,003
Stanford and joined Silicon Valley, every
Friday afternoon he would bring people

22
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:39,009
into the lab into his office and have them
try out whatever they were working on that

23
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:44,003
week. And so that way they were able to
get this regular feedback each week and

24
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:48,009
the people who were building those systems
got to see real people trying them out.

25
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:53,006
This can be nails on a chalkboard painful
but you'll also learn a ton. So how do we

26
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:57,073
get beyond do you like my interface? The
basic strategy that we're going to talk

27
00:01:57,073 --> 00:02:03,008
about today is being able to use specific
measures and concrete questions to be able

28
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:09,000
to deliver meaningful results. One of the
problems of do you like my interface is

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,008
compared to what? And I think one of the
reasons people say, yeah sure is that

30
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:18,006
there's no comparison point and so one
thing that's really important is when

31
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:23,008
you're measuring the effectiveness of your
interface, even informally, it's really

32
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:28,006
nice to have some kind of comparison. It's
also important think about well, what's

33
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:33,000
the yard stick? What constitutes good in
this arena? What are the measures that

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,008
you're gonna use? So how can we get beyond
do you like my interface? One of the ways

35
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:44,000
that we can start out is by asking a base
rate question like, what fraction of

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,066
people click on the first link in a search
results page? Or what fraction of students

37
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:55,000
come to class? Once we start to measure
correlations things get even more

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,009
interesting like, is there a relationship
between the time of day a class is

39
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:04,009
offered? And how many students attend it?
Or is there a relationship between the

40
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:09,005
order of a search result and the
click-through rate? For both students and

41
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:14,001
click-through, there can be multiple
explanations. For example, if there are

42
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:19,000
fewer students that attend early morning
classes, is that a function of when

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,003
students want to show up? Or is that a
good function of when good professors want

44
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:29,004
to teach? With the click-through example,
there are also two kinds of explanations.

45
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:34,005
If lower placed links yield fewer clicks.
Is that because the links are of

46
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:39,005
intrinsically poor quality or is it
because people just click on the first

47
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:44,006
link? They don't, they don't bother
getting to the second one even if it might

48
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:48,009
be better. To isolate the effect of
placement and identifying it as playing a

49
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:53,003
casual role, you'd need to isolate that as
a variable by say, randomizing the order

50
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:58,008
or search results. As we start to talk
about these experiments, let's introduce a

51
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:03,074
few terms that are gonna help us. The
multiple different conditio ns that we

52
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:09,001
try, that's the thing we are manipulating.
For example, the time of the class or the

53
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:14,013
location of a particular link on a search
result page. These manipulations are

54
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:19,020
independent variables because they are
independent of what the user does. They

55
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:25,060
are in the control of the experimenter.
Then we are going to measure what the user

56
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,068
does and those measures are called
dependent variables because they depend on

57
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:36,007
what the user does. Common measures in HCI
include things like task completion time.

58
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:41,040
How long does it take somebody to complete
a task? For example, find something I want

59
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,072
to buy, create a new account, order an
item. Accuracy. How many mistakes did

60
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:50,003
people make? And were those fatal errors
or were those things that they were able

61
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:55,003
to quickly recover from? Recall. How much
does a person remember afterward, or after

62
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,097
periods of non-use? And emotional
response. How does the person feel about

63
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:02,099
the tasks being completed? Were they
confident, were they stressed? Would the

64
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:07,032
user recommend this system to a friend?
So, your independent variables are this

65
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:12,028
things that you manipulate, your dependent
variables are this things that you

66
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:17,013
measure. How reliable is your experiment?
If you ran this again, would you see the

67
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:21,080
same results? That's the internal validity
of an experiment. So, have a precise

68
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,017
experiment, you need to better remove the
confounding factors. Also, it's important

69
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:30,077
to study enough people so that the result
is unlikely to have been by chance. You

70
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:35,091
may be able to run the same study over and
over and get the same results but it may

71
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:39,077
not matter in some real world sense and
the external validity is the

72
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:43,063
generalizability of your results. Does
this apply only to eighteen year olds in a

73
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:47,092
college classroom? Or does this apply to
everybody in the world? Let's bring this

74
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:51,083
back to HCI and talk about one of the
problems you're likely to face as, as a

75
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:56,065
designer. I think one of the things that
we commonly want to be able to do is to be

76
00:05:56,065 --> 00:06:00,056
able to ask something like, is my cool new
approach better than the industry

77
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:04,079
standard? Because aft er all, that's why
you're making the new thing. Now, one of

78
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,085
the challenges with this, especially early
on in the design process is that you may

79
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:14,035
have something which is very much in its
prototype stages and something that is the

80
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:18,096
industry standard is likely to benefit
from years and years of refinement. And at

81
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:23,080
the same time, it may be stuck with years
and years of cruft which may or may not be

82
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,070
intrinsic to its approach. So if you
compare your cool new tool to some

83
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,085
industry standard, there is two things
varying here. One is the fidelity of the

84
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:37,017
implementation and the other one of course
is the approach. Consequently, when you

85
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:41,049
get the results, you can't know whether to
attribute the results to fidelity or

86
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:46,000
approach or some combination of the two.
So we're going to talk about ways of

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,012
teasing apart those different causal
factors. Now, one thing I should say right

88
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:55,014
off the bat is there are some times where
it may be more or less relevant whether

89
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:59,097
you have a good handle on what the causal
factors are. So for example, if you're

90
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:04,028
trying to decide between two different
digital cameras, at the end of the day,

91
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:09,012
maybe all you care about is image quality
or usability or some other factor and

92
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:14,006
exactly what the, makes that image quality
better or worse or any other element along

93
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:19,050
the way may be less relevant to you. If
you don't have control over the variables

94
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,081
then identifying cause may not always be
what you want. But when you are a

95
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:28,078
designer, you do have control over the
variables and that's when it is really

96
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:34,031
important to as you retain cause. Here's
an example of a study that came out right

97
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:39,025
when the iPhone was released, done by a
research firm User Centric, and I'm going

98
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:43,078
to read from this news article here.
Research firm User Centric has released a

99
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:48,098
study that tries to gauge how effective
the iPhone's unusual on screen keyboard

100
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:54,038
is. The goal is certainly a noble one but
I cannot say the survey's approach results

101
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:59,057
in data that makes much sense. User
Centric brought in twenty owners of other

102
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:04,058
phones. Half had qwerty keyboards, half
had ordin ary numeric phones, with

103
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:10,013
keypads. None were familiar with the
iPhone. The research involved having the

104
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:15,069
test subjects enter six sample test
messages with the phones that they already

105
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:20,013
had, and six with the iPhone. The end
result was that the iPhone newbies took

106
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:25,042
twice as long to enter text with an iPhone
as they did with their own phones and made

107
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:31,025
lots more typos. So let's critique this
study and talk about it's benefits and

108
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:35,091
drawbacks. Here's the webpage directly
from User Centric. What's our manipulation

109
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:43,006
in this study? Well the manipulation is
going to be the input style. How about the

110
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:51,006
measure in the study? It's going to be the
words per minute. And there's absolutely

111
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:56,058
value in being able to measure the initial
usability of the iPhone. For several

112
00:08:56,058 --> 00:09:01,091
reasons, one is if you're introducing new
technology it's beneficial if people are

113
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:06,075
able to get up to speed pretty quickly.
However it's important to realize that

114
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:11,029
this comparison is intrinsically unfair
because the users of the, the previous

115
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:16,072
cell phones were experts at that input
modality and the people who are using the

116
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:21,010
iphone are novices in that modality. And
so it seems quite likely that the iPhone

117
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,004
users, once they become actual users are
gonna get better over time and so if

118
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:31,007
you're not used to something the first
time you try it, that may not be a deal

119
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:36,046
killer, and it's certainly not an apples
to apples comparison. Another thing that

120
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:43,000
we don't get out of this article is, is
this difference significant? So we read

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,032
that each person who typed six messages in
each of two conditions and so they did

122
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:56,049
their own device in the iPhone or vice
versa. Six messages each and that the

123
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:03,049
iPhone users were half the speed of the,
or rather the people typing with the

124
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:09,053
iPhone were half as fast as when they got
to type with a mini qwerty and the device

125
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:14,070
that they were accustomed to. So while
this may tell us something about the

126
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,058
initial usability of the iPhone in terms
of the long usability, long-term

127
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:24,048
usability, you know I don't think we get
so much out of this here. If you weren't s

128
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:29,014
atisfied by that initial data, you're in
good company, neither were the authors of

129
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:33,050
that study. So they went back a month
later and they ran another study where

130
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,055
they brought in 40 new people to the lab
who were either iPhone users or Qwerty

131
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:43,064
users or nine key users. And now it's more
of an apples to apples comparison in that

132
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:48,052
they are going to test people that are
relatively experts in these different

133
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:54,002
modalities. After about a month on the
iPhone you're probably starting to ask in

134
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:58,062
terms of your performance. Definitely it
gets better over time, even past a month

135
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:05,004
but you know a month starts to get more
reasonable. And what they found was that

136
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:12,044
iPhone users and Qwerty users were about
the same. And in terms of speed and that

137
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:18,068
the numeric keypad users were much slower.
So once again our manipulation is going to

138
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:24,006
be input style and we're going to measure
speed. This time we're also going to

139
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:30,005
measure error rate. And what we see is
that iPhone users and Qwerty users are

140
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:37,004
essentially the same speed. However, the
iPhone users make many more errors. Now,

141
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:43,001
one thing I should point out about the
study is that each of the different

142
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:49,006
devices was used by a different group of
people. And it was done this way so that

143
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:54,009
each, each device was used by somebody who
is comfortable and had experience with

144
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:59,008
working with that device. And so, we
removed the worry that you had newbies

145
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:04,004
working on these devices. However,
especially in 2007, there may have been

146
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:10,000
significant differences in who the people
were who were using the early adopters of

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,061
the 2007 iPhone or maybe business users
were particularly drawn to the Qwerty

148
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:20,059
devices or people who had better things to
do with their time than send e-mail on

149
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:25,001
their telephone or using the nine key
devices. And so, while this comparison is

150
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:29,005
better than the previous one, the
potential for variation between the user

151
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:34,000
populations is still problematic. If what
you'd like to be able to claim is

152
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,007
something about the intrinsic properties
of the device and may at least in part

153
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:45,047
have to do with the users. So, what are
some st rategies for fairer comparison? To

154
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:50,068
brainstorm a couple of options one thing
you could do is insert your approach in to

155
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:55,025
your production setting and this may seem
like a lot of work, sometimes it is but in

156
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:59,065
the age of the web this is a lot easier
than it used to be. And it's possible even

157
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:03,024
if you don't have access to these server
of the service that you're comparing

158
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:08,001
against. You can use things like a proxy
server or client type scripting to be able

159
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:12,034
to put your own technique in and have an
apples to apples comparison. A second

160
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:18,007
strategy for neutralizing the environment
difference between a production version

161
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:24,040
and your new approach is to make a version
of the production thing in the same style

162
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,005
as your new approach. That also makes them
equivalent in terms of their

163
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:34,003
implementation fidelity. A third strategy
and one that's used commonly in research,

164
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:38,003
is to scale things down so you're looking
at just a piece of the system at a

165
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:42,004
particular point in time. That way you
don't have to worry about implementing a

166
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:46,002
whole big, giant thing. You can just focus
on one small piece and have that

167
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:52,009
comparison be fair. And the fourth
strategy is that when expertise is

168
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:57,007
relevant, train people up. Give them the
practice that they need so that they can

169
00:13:57,007 --> 00:14:02,005
start at least hitting that asymptote in
terms of performance and you can get a

170
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:07,004
better read than, what they would be as
newbies. So now to close out this lecture

171
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:12,004
if somebody asks you the question, is
interface x better than interface y? You

172
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:16,048
know that we're off to a good start
because we have a comparison. However, you

173
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:21,007
also know to be worried. What does better
mean? And often, in a complex system,

174
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:26,000
you're going to have several measures.
That's totally cool. There's a lot of

175
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,053
value in being explicit though about what
it is you mean by better. What are you

176
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:36,001
trying to accomplish? What are you trying
to approve? And if anybody ever tells you

177
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:40,008
that their interface is always better,
don't believe them because nearly all of

178
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:47,001
the time the answer is going to be, it
depends. And the interesting question is,

179
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:53,004
what does it depend on? Most interfaces
are good for something and not for others.

180
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:57,072
For example if you have a tablet computer
where all of the screen is devoted to

181
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:02,034
display, that is going to be great for
reading, for web browsing, for that kind

182
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:07,007
of activity, looking at pictures. Not so
good if you want to type a novel. So here,

183
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:12,009
we've introduced controlled comparison as
a way of finding the smoking gun, as a way

184
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:18,000
of inferring cause. And often for, when
you have only two conditions, we're gonna

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
talk about that as being a minimal pairs
design. As a practicing designer, the

186
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,005
reason to care about what's causal is that
it gives you the material to make a better

187
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:33,024
decision going forward. A lot of studies
violate this constraint. And, that gets

188
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:37,035
dangerous because it doesn't, it prevents
you from being able to make sound

189
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:42,060
decisions. I hope that the tools that
we've talked about today and in the next

190
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:50,011
several lectures will help you become a
wise skeptic like our friend in this XKCD

191
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:53,001
Comic. I'll see you next time.
