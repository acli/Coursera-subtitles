1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,089
In this lecture, we’re going to talk about trying out your interface with people

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:12,005
and doing so in a way that you can improve your designs based on what you learned.

3
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:16,080
One of the most common things that people ask when running studies is: “Do you like my interface?”

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,098
and it’s a really natural thing to ask, because on some level it’s what we all want to know.

5
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:23,091
But this is really problematic on a whole lot of levels.

6
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:28,009
For one it’s not very specific, and so sometimes people are trying to make this better

7
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:34,035
and so they’ll improve it by doing something like: “How much do you like my interface on one to five scale?”

8
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:39,040
Or: “‘This is a useful interface’ — Agree or disagree on one to five scale.”

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,063
And this adds some kind of a patina of scientificness to it

10
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:46,074
but really it’s just the same thing — you’re asking somebody “Do you like my interface?”

11
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:49,067
And people are nice, so they’re going to say “Sure I like your interface.”

12
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:52,025
This is the “please the experimenter” bias.

13
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:56,069
And this can be especially strong when there are social or cultural or power differences

14
00:00:56,069 --> 00:01:00,060
between the experimenter and the people that you’re trying out your interface with:

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,006
For example, [inaudible] and colleague show this effect in India

16
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:09,031
where this effect was exacerbated when the experimenter was white.

17
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:15,090
Now, you should <i>not</i> take this to mean that you shouldn’t have your developers try out stuff with users —

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,079
Being the person who is both the developer and the person who is trying stuff out is incredible valuable.

19
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,052
And one example I like a lot of this is Mike Krieger,

20
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:30,012
one of the Instagram founders — [he] is also a former master student and TA of mine.

21
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:32,031
And Mike, when he left Stanford and joined Silicon Valley,

22
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:36,048
every Friday afternoon he would bring people into the lab into his office

23
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:39,060
and have them try out whatever they were working on that week.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,021
And so that way they were able to get this regular feedback each week

25
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:48,000
and the people who were building those systems got to see real people trying them out.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,016
This can be nails-on-a-chalkboard painful, but you’ll also learn a ton.

27
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:55,011
So how do we get beyond “Do you like my interface?”

28
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:58,097
The basic strategy that we’re going to talk about today is being able

29
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:05,003
to use specific measures and concrete questions to be able to deliver meaningful results.

30
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:10,021
One of the problems of “Do you like my interface?” is “Compared to what?”

31
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:16,010
And I think one of the reasons people say “Yeah sure” is that there’s no comparison point

32
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,088
and so one thing that’s really important is when you’re measuring the effectiveness of your interface,

33
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:25,078
even informally, it’s really nice to have some kind of comparison.

34
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,068
It’s also important think about, well, what’s the yardstick?

35
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:31,018
What constitutes “good” in this arena?

36
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,092
What are the measures that you’re going to use?

37
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:36,088
So how can we get beyond “Do you like my interface?”

38
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:41,007
One of the ways that we can start out is by asking a base rate question,

39
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:46,052
like “What fraction of people click on the first link in a search results page?”

40
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:50,014
Or “What fraction of students come to class?”

41
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:54,055
Once we start to measure correlations things get even more interesting,

42
00:02:54,055 --> 00:03:00,032
like, “Is there a relationship between the time of day a class is offered and how many students attend it?”

43
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:07,061
Or “Is there a relationship between the order of a search result and the clickthrough rate?”

44
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,049
For both students and clickthrough, there can be multiple explanations.

45
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:16,040
For example, if there are fewer students that attend early morning classes,

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,005
is that a function of when students want to show up,

47
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:22,086
or is that a function of when good professors want to teach?

48
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:26,021
With the clickthrough example, there are also two kinds of explanations.

49
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:37,052
If lower placed links yield fewer clicks, Is that because the links are of intrinsically poorer quality,

50
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:41,007
or is it because people just click on the first link —

51
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:45,023
[that] they don’t bother getting to the second one even if it might be better?

52
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:48,086
To isolate the effect of placement and identifying it as playing a casual role,

53
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:54,015
you’d need to isolate that as a variable by say, randomizing the order or search results.

54
00:03:54,015 --> 00:04:00,032
As we start to talk about these experiments, let’s introduce a few terms that are going to help us.

55
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:05,048
The multiple different conditions that we try, that’s the thing we are manipulating —

56
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:12,040
for example, the time of a class, or the location of a particular link on a search results page.

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,037
These manipulations are independent variables because they are independent of what the user does.

58
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:22,024
They are in the control of the experimenter.

59
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:26,070
Then we are going to measure what the user does

60
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,044
and those measures are called dependent variables because they depend on what the user does.

61
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:36,000
Common measures in HCI include things like task completion time —

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,098
How long does it take somebody to complete a task

63
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:43,037
(for example, find something I want to buy, create a new account, order an item)?

64
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:46,083
Accuracy — How many mistakes did people make,

65
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:51,029
and were those fatal errors or were those things that they were able to quickly recover from?

66
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:55,037
Recall — How much does a person remember afterward, or after periods of non-use?

67
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:59,018
And emotional response — How does the person feel about the tasks being completed?

68
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:01,044
Were they confident, were they stressed?

69
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:04,035
Would the user recommend this system to a friend?

70
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:09,007
So, your independent variables are the things that you manipulate,

71
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,098
your dependent variables are the things that you measure.

72
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:14,003
How reliable is your experiment?

73
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:17,057
If you ran this again, would you see the same results?

74
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:20,092
That’s the internal validity of an experiment.

75
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:24,077
So, have a precise experiment, you need to better remove the confounding factors.

76
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:30,034
Also, it’s important to study enough people so that the result is unlikely to have been by chance.

77
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:34,037
You may be able to run the same study over and over and get the same results

78
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:42,021
but it may not matter in some real-world sense and the external validity is the generalizability of your results.

79
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:44,089
Does this apply only to eighteen-year-olds in a college classroom?

80
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:47,090
Or does this apply to everybody in the world?

81
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,000
Let’s bring this back to HCI and talk about one of the problems you’re likely to face as a designer.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,049
I think one of the things that we commonly want to be able to do

83
00:05:55,049 --> 00:06:00,036
is to be able to ask something like “Is my cool new approach better than the industry standard?”

84
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:03,029
Because after all, that’s why you’re making the new thing.

85
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,095
Now, one of the challenges with this, especially early on in the design process

86
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:11,002
is that you may have something which is very much in its prototype stages

87
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:16,084
and something that is the industry standard is likely to benefit from years and years of refinement.

88
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:21,051
And at the same time, it may be stuck with years and years of cruft

89
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:25,011
which may or may not be intrinsic to its approach.

90
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:30,058
So if you compare your cool new tool to some industry standard, there is two things varying here.

91
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:35,072
One is the fidelity of the implementation and the other one of course is the approach.

92
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,082
Consequently, when you get the results,

93
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:43,093
you can’t know whether to attribute the results to fidelity or approach or some combination of the two.

94
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:48,039
So we’re going to talk about ways of teasing apart those different causal factors.

95
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,071
Now, one thing I should say right off the bat is there are some times where it may be more

96
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:57,033
or less relevant whether you have a good handle on what the causal factors are.

97
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:01,040
So for example, if you’re trying to decide between two different digital cameras,

98
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,073
at the end of the day, maybe all you care about is image quality or usability or some other factor

99
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:12,082
and exactly what makes that image quality better or worse

100
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:17,083
or any other element along the way may be less relevant to you.

101
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:24,003
If you don’t have control over the variables, then identifying cause may not always be what you want.

102
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:27,069
But when you are a designer, you do have control over the variables,

103
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,071
and that’s when it is really important to ascertain cause.

104
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:35,095
Here’s an example of a study that came out right when the iPhone was released,

105
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:41,004
done by a research firm User Centric, and I’m going to read from this news article here.

106
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:43,049
Research firm User Centric has released a study

107
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:48,073
that tries to gauge how effective the iPhone’s unusual onscreen keyboard is.

108
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:51,006
The goal is certainly a noble one

109
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:56,033
but I cannot say the survey’s approach results in data that makes much sense.

110
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:59,085
User Centric brought in twenty owners of other phones.

111
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:05,011
Half had qwerty keyboards, half had ordinary numeric phones, with keypads.

112
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:08,008
None were familiar with the iPhone.

113
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:13,067
The research involved having the test subjects enter six sample test messages with the phones

114
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:17,033
that they already had, and six with the iPhone.

115
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:20,081
The end result was that the iPhone newbies took twice as long

116
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:26,078
to enter text with an iPhone as they did with their own phones and made lots more typos.

117
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:31,062
So let’s critique this study and talk about its benefits and drawbacks.

118
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:34,002
Here’s the webpage directly from User Centric.

119
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:37,061
What’s our manipulation in this study?

120
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:41,077
Well the manipulation is going to be the input style.

121
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:45,007
How about the measure in the study?

122
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:48,062
It’s going to be the words per minute.

123
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:56,031
And there’s absolutely value in being able to measure the initial usability of the iPhone.

124
00:08:56,031 --> 00:09:00,036
For several reasons, one is if you’re introducing new technology,

125
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:03,067
it’s beneficial if people are able to get up to speed pretty quickly.

126
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:09,032
However it’s important to realize that this comparison is intrinsically unfair

127
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:14,094
because the users of the previous cell phones were experts at that input modality

128
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:18,069
and the people who are using the iphone are novices in that modality.

129
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:24,003
And so it seems quite likely that the iPhone users, once they become actual users,

130
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:29,047
are going to get better over time and so if you’re not used to something the first time you try it,

131
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:35,005
that may not be a deal killer, and it’s certainly not an apples-to-apples comparison.

132
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:40,000
Another thing that we don’t get out of this article is “Is this difference significant?”

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,096
So we read that each person who typed six messages in each of two conditions

134
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:52,000
and so they did their own device and the iPhone, or vice versa.

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Six messages each and that the iPhone users were half the speed of the…

136
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,081
or rather the people typing with the iPhone were half as fast as when they got to type with a mini qwerty

137
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:12,057
at the device that they were accustomed to.

138
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:17,013
So while this may tell us something about the initial usability of the iPhone,

139
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:23,001
in terms of the long-term usability, you know, I don’t think we get so much out of this here.

140
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:29,081
If you weren’t s atisfied by that initial data, you’re in good company: neither were the authors of that study.

141
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:35,045
So they went back a month later and they ran another study where they brought in 40 new people to the lab

142
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:39,094
who were either iPhone users, qwerty users, or nine key users.

143
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:42,087
And now it’s more of an apples-to-apples comparison

144
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:48,098
in that they are going to test people that are relatively experts in these three different modalities —

145
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:55,030
after about a month on the iPhone you’re <i>probably</i> starting to asymptote in terms of your performance.

146
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:02,087
Definitely it gets better over time, even past a month; but, you know, a month starts to get more reasonable.

147
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:12,001
And what they found was that iPhone users and qwerty users were about the same in terms of speed,

148
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:16,092
and that the numeric keypad users were much slower.

149
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:21,073
So once again our manipulation is going to be input style and we’re going to measure speed.

150
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:24,055
This time we’re also going to measure error rate.

151
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:30,041
And what we see is that iPhone users and qwerty users are essentially the same speed.

152
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:36,054
However, the iPhone users make many more errors.

153
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:40,015
Now, one thing I should point out about the study is

154
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:46,077
that each of the different devices was used by a different group of people.

155
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:51,059
And it was done this way so that each device was used by somebody

156
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,088
who is comfortable and had experience with working with that device.

157
00:11:55,088 --> 00:12:00,051
And so, we removed the worry that you had newbies working on these devices.

158
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:04,059
However, especially in 2007, there may have been significant differences

159
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:11,030
in who the people were who were using the early adopters of the 2007 iPhone

160
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:17,005
or maybe business users were particularly drawn to the qwerty devices or people who had better things

161
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:22,045
to do with their time than send e-mail on their telephone or using the nine key devices.

162
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:26,063
And so, while this comparison is better than the previous one,

163
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:31,050
the potential for variation between the user populations is still problematic.

164
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,083
If what you’d like to be able to claim is something about the intrinsic properties of the device,

165
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:42,021
it may at least in part have to do with the users.

166
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:45,044
So, what are some st rategies for fairer comparison?

167
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:50,025
To brainstorm a couple of options one thing that you can do is insert your approach in to your production setting

168
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:52,068
and this may seem like a lot of work —

169
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:56,054
sometimes it is but in the age of the web this is a lot easier than it used to be.

170
00:12:56,054 --> 00:13:03,012
And it’s possible even if you don’t have access to the server of the service that you’re comparing against.

171
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:06,056
You can use things like a proxy server or client-side scripting

172
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:11,056
to be able to put your own technique in and have an apples-to-apples comparison.

173
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:16,057
A second strategy for neutralizing the environment difference between a production version

174
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:25,069
and your new approach is to make a version of the production thing in the same style as your new approach.

175
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:30,089
That also makes them equivalent in terms of their implementation fidelity.

176
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:34,000
A third strategy and one that’s used commonly in research,

177
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,042
is to scale things down so you’re looking at just a piece of the system at a particular point in time.

178
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:42,071
That way you don’t have to worry about implementing a whole big, giant thing.

179
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:48,018
You can just focus on one small piece and have that comparison be fair.

180
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:52,077
And the fourth strategy is that when expertise is relevant,

181
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:55,085
train people up — give them the practice that they need —,

182
00:13:55,085 --> 00:14:00,074
so that they can start at least hitting that asymptote in terms of performance

183
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:04,099
and you can get a better read than what they would be as newbies.

184
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:11,080
So now to close out this lecture, if somebody asks you the question “Is interface x better than interface y?”

185
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,025
you know that we’re off to a good start because we have a comparison.

186
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:18,054
However, you also know to be worried: What does “better” mean?

187
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:25,096
And often, in a complex system, you’re going to have several measures. That’s totally cool.

188
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:30,057
There’s a lot of value in being explicit though about what it is you mean by better —

189
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:33,072
What are you trying to accomplish? What are you trying to [im]prove?

190
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:38,000
And if anybody ever tells you that their interface is <i>always</i> better,

191
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,029
don’t believe them because nearly all of the time the answer is going to be “it depends.”

192
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,044
And the interesting question is “What does it depend on?”

193
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:53,000
Most interfaces are good for some things and not for others.

194
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,097
For example if you have a tablet computer where all of the screen is devoted to display,

195
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:04,020
that is going to be great for reading, for web browsing, for that kind of activity, looking at pictures.

196
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,037
Not so good if you want to type a novel.

197
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:09,014
So here, we’ve introduced controlled comparison

198
00:15:09,014 --> 00:15:13,077
as a way of finding the smoking gun, as a way of inferring cause.

199
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:17,031
And often for, when you have only two conditions,

200
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:21,000
we’re going to talk about that as being a minimal pairs design.

201
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,091
As a practicing designer, the reason to care about what’s causal

202
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:29,060
is that it gives you the material to make a better decision going forward.

203
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,020
A lot of studies violate this constraint.

204
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:39,071
And, that gets dangerous because it doesn’t, it prevents you from being able to make sound decisions.

205
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:43,079
I hope that the tools that we’ve talked about today and in the next several lectures

206
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:48,082
will help you become a wise skeptic like our friend in this XKCD comic.

207
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:53,000
I’ll see you next time.
