1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,818
In this lecture, we’re going to talk about trying out your interface with people, 

2
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:12,005
and doing so in a way that you can improve your designs based on what you learned.

3
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:15,826
One of the most common things that people ask when running studies is, do you like my interface?

4
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:20,451
And it’s a really natural thing to ask because on some level it’s what we all want to know.

5
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:23,756
But this is really problematic on a whole lot of levels.

6
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:29,228
For one it’s not very specific and so sometimes people will try and make this better and so they’ll, 

7
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:34,342
they’ll improve it by doing something like how much do you like my interface on a one to five scale?

8
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:36,532
Or this is a useful interface.

9
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:38,656
Agree or disagree on a one to five scale?

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,327
And this adds some kind of patina of scientificness to it 

11
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:44,225
but really its just the same thing you’re asking somebody.

12
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,530
Do you like my interface?

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,066
And people are nice so they’re going to say, sure I like your interface.

14
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:51,964
This is the please the experimenter bias.

15
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:55,582
And this can be especially strong when there are social or cultural 

16
00:00:55,582 --> 00:01:00,789
or power differences between the experimenter and the people that you are trying out your interface with.

17
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:05,491
For example [inaudible] and colleagues showed these in effect in India, 

18
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:10,003
where this effect was exacerbated when the examiner was white.

19
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:15,694
Now you should not take this to mean that you shouldn’t have your developers try out stuff with users.

20
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:22,000
Being the person who is both the developer and the person who is trying stuff out is incredibly valuable.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,260
And one example I like a lot of this is by Mike Krieger, 

22
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,725
one of the Instagram founders is also a former master student and TA of mine.

23
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:32,313
And Mike, when he left Stanford and joined Silicon Valley, 

24
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:36,483
every Friday afternoon he would bring people into the lab into his office 

25
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:39,606
and have them try out whatever they were working on that week.

26
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:44,525
And so that way they were able to get this regular feedback each week and the people 

27
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:48,009
who were building those systems got to see real people trying them out.

28
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:52,169
This can be nails on a chalkboard painful but you’ll also learn a ton.

29
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:55,118
So how do we get beyond do you like my interface?

30
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,972
The basic strategy that we’re going to talk about today is being able 

31
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:05,362
to use specific measures and concrete questions to be able to deliver meaningful results.

32
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:09,770
One of the problems of do you like my interface is compared to what?

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:16,102
And I think one of the reasons people say, yeah sure is that there’s no comparison point and so one thing 

34
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:21,151
that’s really important is when you’re measuring the effectiveness of your interface, 

35
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:25,783
even informally, it’s really nice to have some kind of comparison.

36
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,687
It’s also important think about well, what’s the yard stick?

37
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:31,184
What constitutes good in this arena?

38
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,925
What are the measures that you’re going to use?

39
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:36,885
So how can we get beyond do you like my interface?

40
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:42,948
One of the ways that we can start out is by asking a base rate question like, 

41
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:47,080
what fraction of people click on the first link in a search results page?

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,142
Or what fraction of students come to class?

43
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:56,078
Once we start to measure correlations things get even more interesting like, 

44
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:59,543
is there a relationship between the time of day a class is offered?

45
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:01,501
And how many students attend it?

46
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:07,610
Or is there a relationship between the order of a search result and the click-through rate?

47
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,077
For both students and click-through, there can be multiple explanations.

48
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:17,333
For example, if there are fewer students that attend early morning classes, 

49
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,362
is that a function of when students want to show up?

50
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:24,403
Or is that a good function of when good professors want to teach?

51
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:29,004
With the click-through example, there are also two kinds of explanations.

52
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:31,728
If lower placed links yield fewer clicks.

53
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:39,205
Is that because the links are of intrinsically poor quality or is it because people just click on the first link?

54
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:44,746
They don’t, they don’t bother getting to the second one even if it might be better.

55
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:48,869
To isolate the effect of placement and identifying it as playing a casual role, 

56
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:54,155
you’d need to isolate that as a variable by say, randomizing the order or search results.

57
00:03:54,155 --> 00:04:00,329
As we start to talk about these experiments, let’s introduce a few terms that are going to help us.

58
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:06,239
The multiple different conditio ns that we try, that’s the thing we are manipulating.

59
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,402
For example, the time of the class or the location of a particular link on a search result page.

60
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:18,641
These manipulations are independent variables because they are independent of what the user does.

61
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:22,245
They are in the control of the experimenter.

62
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:28,460
Then we are going to measure what the user does and those measures are called dependent variables 

63
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,447
because they depend on what the user does.

64
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:36,007
Common measures in HCI include things like task completion time.

65
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:38,983
How long does it take somebody to complete a task?

66
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:43,380
For example, find something I want to buy, create a new account, order an item.

67
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,160
Accuracy.

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,776
How many mistakes did people make?

69
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:51,298
And were those fatal errors or were those things that they were able to quickly recover from?

70
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:52,038
Recall.

71
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,717
How much does a person remember afterward, or after periods of non-use?

72
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,145
And emotional response.

73
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:59,183
How does the person feel about the tasks being completed?

74
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:01,717
Were they confident, were they stressed?

75
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:04,354
Would the user recommend this system to a friend?

76
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:09,075
So, your independent variables are this things that you manipulate, 

77
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,983
your dependent variables are this things that you measure.

78
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:14,893
How reliable is your experiment?

79
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:17,573
If you ran this again, would you see the same results?

80
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:19,953
That’s the internal validity of an experiment.

81
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:24,776
So, have a precise experiment, you need to better remove the confounding factors.

82
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:29,917
Also, it’s important to study enough people so that the result is unlikely to have been by chance.

83
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:34,373
You may be able to run the same study over and over and get the same results 

84
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:41,135
but it may not matter in some real world sense and the external validity is the generalizability of your results.

85
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,898
Does this apply only to eighteen year olds in a college classroom?

86
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:46,570
Or does this apply to everybody in the world?

87
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:52,003
Let’s bring this back to HCI and talk about one of the problems you’re likely to face as, as a designer.

88
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:55,499
I think one of the things that we commonly want to be able to do 

89
00:05:55,499 --> 00:06:00,364
is to be able to ask something like, is my cool new approach better than the industry standard?

90
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:03,290
Because aft er all, that’s why you’re making the new thing.

91
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,079
Now, one of the challenges with this, especially early on in the design process 

92
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,441
is that you may have something which is very much in its prototype stages and something 

93
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:17,779
that is the industry standard is likely to benefit from years and years of refinement.

94
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,683
And at the same time, it may be stuck with years 

95
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:25,114
and years of cruft which may or may not be intrinsic to its approach.

96
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:30,586
So if you compare your cool new tool to some industry standard, there is two things varying here.

97
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:35,725
One is the fidelity of the implementation and the other one of course is the approach.

98
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,822
Consequently, when you get the results, 

99
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:43,933
you can’t know whether to attribute the results to fidelity or approach or some combination of the two.

100
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:48,400
So we’re going to talk about ways of teasing apart those different causal factors.

101
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,712
Now, one thing I should say right off the bat is there are some times where it may be more 

102
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:57,840
or less relevant whether you have a good handle on what the causal factors are.

103
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,499
So for example, if you’re trying to decide between two different digital cameras, 

104
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:06,684
at the end of the day, maybe all you care about is image quality 

105
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:11,834
or usability or some other factor and exactly what the, makes that image quality better 

106
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:16,526
or worse or any other element along the way may be less relevant to you.

107
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:22,109
If you don’t have control over the variables then identifying cause may not always be what you want.

108
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:26,770
But when you are a designer, you do have control over the variables and 

109
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,718
that’s when it is really important to as you retain cause.

110
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:35,951
Here’s an example of a study that came out right when the iPhone was released, 

111
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:41,041
done by a research firm User Centric, and I’m going to read from this news article here.

112
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,496
Research firm User Centric has released a study 

113
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:48,734
that tries to gauge how effective the iPhone’s unusual on screen keyboard is.

114
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,066
The goal is certainly a noble one 

115
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:56,337
but I cannot say the survey’s approach results in data that makes much sense.

116
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:59,857
User Centric brought in twenty owners of other phones.

117
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:05,118
Half had qwerty keyboards, half had ordin ary numeric phones, with keypads.

118
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,086
None were familiar with the iPhone.

119
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:13,677
The research involved having the test subjects enter six sample test messages with the phones 

120
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:17,335
that they already had, and six with the iPhone.

121
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:20,817
The end result was that the iPhone newbies took twice as long 

122
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:26,785
to enter text with an iPhone as they did with their own phones and made lots more typos.

123
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:31,625
So let’s critique this study and talk about it’s benefits and drawbacks.

124
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,025
Here’s the webpage directly from User Centric.

125
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:36,307
What’s our manipulation in this study?

126
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:41,779
Well the manipulation is going to be the input style.

127
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,078
How about the measure in the study?

128
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:48,630
It’s going to be the words per minute.

129
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,374
And there’s absolutely value in being able to measure the initial usability of the iPhone.

130
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:58,476
For several reasons, one is if you’re introducing new 

131
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:03,678
technology it’s beneficial if people are able to get up to speed pretty quickly.

132
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:08,649
However it’s important to realize that this comparison is intrinsically unfair 

133
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,637
because the users of the, the previous cell phones were experts at 

134
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:18,696
that input modality and the people who are using the iphone are novices in that modality.

135
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:24,036
And so it seems quite likely that the iPhone users, once they become actual users are going 

136
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:29,476
to get better over time and so if you’re not used to something the first time you try it, 

137
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:35,060
that may not be a deal killer, and it’s certainly not an apples to apples comparison.

138
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:42,162
Another thing that we don’t get out of this article is, is this difference significant?

139
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:46,965
So we read that each person who typed six messages in each 

140
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:54,112
of two conditions and so they did their own device in the iPhone or vice versa.

141
00:09:54,112 --> 00:10:00,001
Six messages each and that the iPhone users were half the speed of the, 

142
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:04,381
or rather the people typing with the iPhone were half 

143
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:11,357
as fast as when they got to type with a mini qwerty and the device that they were accustomed to.

144
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:18,654
So while this may tell us something about the initial usability of the iPhone in terms of the long usability, 

145
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:23,014
long-term usability, you know I don’t think we get so much out of this here.

146
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:29,819
If you weren’t s atisfied by that initial data, you’re in good company, neither were the authors of that study.

147
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,450
So they went back a month later and they ran another study where they brought in 40 new people to the lab 

148
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,947
who were either iPhone users or Qwerty users or nine key users.

149
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:42,871
And now it’s more of an apples to apples comparison in 

150
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:49,420
that they are going to test people that are relatively experts in these different modalities.

151
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,307
After about a month on the iPhone you’re probably starting to ask in terms of your performance.

152
00:10:55,307 --> 00:11:02,878
Definitely it gets better over time, even past a month but you know a month starts to get more reasonable.

153
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:10,134
And what they found was that iPhone users and Qwerty users were about the same.

154
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:15,244
And in terms of speed and that the numeric keypad users were much slower.

155
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:21,938
So once again our manipulation is going to be input style and we’re going to measure speed.

156
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:26,004
This time we’re also going to measure error rate.

157
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:32,185
And what we see is that iPhone users and Qwerty users are essentially the same speed.

158
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:36,545
However, the iPhone users make many more errors.

159
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:40,891
Now, one thing I should point out about the study is 

160
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:46,775
that each of the different devices was used by a different group of people.

161
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:51,596
And it was done this way so that each, each device was used by somebody 

162
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:55,881
who is comfortable and had experience with working with that device.

163
00:11:55,881 --> 00:12:00,518
And so, we removed the worry that you had newbies working on these devices.

164
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:05,780
However, especially in 2007, there may have been significant differences 

165
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,310
in who the people were who were using the early adopters of the 2007 iPhone 

166
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:17,053
or maybe business users were particularly drawn to the Qwerty devices or people who had better things 

167
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:23,119
to do with their time than send e-mail on their telephone or using the nine key devices.

168
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:26,639
And so, while this comparison is better than the previous one, 

169
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,501
the potential for variation between the user populations is still problematic.

170
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,992
If what you’d like to be able to claim is something about the intrinsic properties 

171
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:40,427
of the device and may at least in part have to do with the users.

172
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,783
So, what are some st rategies for fairer comparison?

173
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:49,607
To brainstorm a couple of options one thing you could do is insert your approach 

174
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:52,918
in to your production setting and this may seem like a lot 

175
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:58,005
of work, sometimes it is but in the age of the web this is a lot easier than it used to be.

176
00:12:58,005 --> 00:13:03,788
And it’s possible even if you don’t have access to these server of the service that you’re comparing against.

177
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:07,226
You can use things like a proxy server or client type scripting 

178
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:11,566
to be able to put your own technique in and have an apples to apples comparison.

179
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:18,007
A second strategy for neutralizing the environment difference between a production version 

180
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:25,692
and your new approach is to make a version of the production thing in the same style as your new approach.

181
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:30,897
That also makes them equivalent in terms of their implementation fidelity.

182
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:34,003
A third strategy and one that’s used commonly in research, 

183
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:39,423
is to scale things down so you’re looking at just a piece of the system at a particular point in time.

184
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:43,388
That way you don’t have to worry about implementing a whole big, giant thing.

185
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:48,186
You can just focus on one small piece and have that comparison be fair.

186
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:53,929
And the fourth strategy is that when expertise is relevant, train people up.

187
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:58,142
Give them the practice that they need so that they can start at least hitting 

188
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:04,990
that asymptote in terms of performance and you can get a better read than, what they would be as newbies.

189
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:11,804
So now to close out this lecture if somebody asks you the question, is interface x better than interface y?

190
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:15,259
You know that we’re off to a good start because we have a comparison.

191
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,695
However, you also know to be worried.

192
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:18,610
What does better mean?

193
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,594
And often, in a complex system, you’re going to have several measures.

194
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:24,987
That’s totally cool.

195
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:29,360
There’s a lot of value in being explicit though about what it is you mean by better.

196
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,193
What are you trying to accomplish?

197
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:33,245
What are you trying to approve?

198
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:38,003
And if anybody ever tells you that their interface is always better, 

199
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:44,296
don’t believe them because nearly all of the time the answer is going to be, it depends.

200
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:48,441
And the interesting question is, what does it depend on?

201
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:53,004
Most interfaces are good for something and not for others.

202
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:57,972
For example if you have a tablet computer where all of the screen is devoted to display, 

203
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:04,204
that is going to be great for reading, for web browsing, for that kind of activity, looking at pictures.

204
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,374
Not so good if you want to type a novel.

205
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:09,143
So here, we’ve introduced controlled comparison 

206
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:13,777
as a way of finding the smoking gun, as a way of inferring cause.

207
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:17,313
And often for, when you have only two conditions, 

208
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:21,000
we’re going to talk about that as being a minimal pairs design.

209
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,920
As a practicing designer, the reason to care about what’s causal 

210
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,605
is that it gives you the material to make a better decision going forward.

211
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:32,205
A lot of studies violate this constraint.

212
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:38,080
And, that gets dangerous because it doesn’t, it prevents you from being able to make sound decisions.

213
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,215
I hope that the tools that we’ve talked about today 

214
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:50,931
and in the next several lectures will help you become a wise skeptic like our friend in this XKCD Comic.

215
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,001
I’ll see you next time.
