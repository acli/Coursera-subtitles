what we are going to talk about in this next lecture is observing people

2
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to discover their needs goals and values

3
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
one effective starting point for designing new technology is to clearly

4
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
identify an existing problem or need

5
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and that's because the needs often reveal important untapped opportunities

6
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
observing people often helps you build empathy

7
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and think from their point of view

8
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to stand in someone elses shoes or maybe wear someone elses gloves

99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
mike (kinyovsky?) is a colleague of mine

10
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and consultant and author

11
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
when we were talking about the roll of fieldwork and design

12
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
he gave me the example of an electronics firm that makes

13
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
devices for truckers

14
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
apparently the systems were underused and sometimes

15
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
when responses were provided they were minimal

16
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
these mobile devices had small physical keyboards

17
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
when the designers went into the field and spent time with

18
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the truckers that used them they found that many

19
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
truckers had big hands and bulky gloves making it impossible

20
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to use the tiny keys

21
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the resulting redesign featured a large touch screen

22
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
this interface provided common responses with one click

23
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
as opposed to lots of typing

24
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and the (dynamic?) display made it possible to have

25
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
big buttons and a stylus was introduced for precision input

26
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
when that was necessary

27
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
from this example you can see the wisdom of something

28
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
attributed to yogi berra, that you can observe a lot just by watching

29
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
what we're going to talk about today is participant observation techniques

30
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
for standing in someone elses shoes

31
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
of course observing is not the only way to begin designing an effect user interface

32
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
great design emerge through all sorts of approaches

33
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that said, it's often a good strategy to begin your design process

34
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
by attuning yourself to your users
