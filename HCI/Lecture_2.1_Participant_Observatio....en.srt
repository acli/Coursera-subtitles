1
00:00:00,021 --> 00:00:07,037
What we’re going to talk about in this next lecture is observing people to discover their needs, goals, and values.

2
00:00:07,037 --> 00:00:14,047
One effective starting point for designing new technology is to clearly identify an existing problem or need.

3
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:21,058
And that’s because finding a big problem and need often yield[s] important untapped opportunities for design.

4
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:26,030
Observing people can also help you build empathy and think from their point of view,

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,077
to stand in someone elses shoes or maybe to wear someone else’s gloves.

6
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:34,096
Mike Kuniavsky is a colleague of mine and a design consultant and author.

7
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:36,097
When we were talking about the role of fieldwork and design,

8
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:41,057
he gave me the example of an electronics firm that makes devices for truckers.

9
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:44,074
Apparently, the systems were underused

10
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:48,075
and sometimes, when responses were provided, they were pretty minimal.

11
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:52,092
These mobile devices had small physical keyboards.

12
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:57,019
When the designers went into the field and spent time with the truckers that used them,

13
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:00,063
they found that many truckers had big hands and wore bulky gloves,

14
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:04,051
making it near impossible to use the tiny keys.

15
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:07,071
The resulting redesign featured a large touch screen.

16
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:13,034
This interface provided common responses with one click, as opposed to lots of typing.

17
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:17,005
And the dynamical display made it possible to have big buttons

18
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:21,083
and a stylus was introduced for precision input when that was necessary.

19
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:25,071
From this example you can see the wisdom of something attributed to Yogi Berra,

20
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:29,015
that “you can observe a lot just by watching.”

21
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:32,017
What we’re going to talk about today is participant observation techniques,

22
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:34,012
for standing in someone else’s shoes.

23
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:38,084
Of course, observing people isn’t the only way to begin designing an effective user interface.

24
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:41,042
Great designs emerge through all sorts of approaches.

25
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:48,034
That said, it's often a good strategy to begin your design process by attuning yourself to your users.

26
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:51,037
The techniques in this lecture are inspired by the fieldwork strategies

27
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:54,079
that anthropologists use to learn about and document culture.

28
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,006
In 1914, Bronisław Malinowski travelled to Papua New Guinea,

29
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:02,088
where he conducted fieldwork at Mailu in the Trobriand Islands.

30
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:05,054
While he is there, World War I breaks out.

31
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:10,091
He has two options: either hang out in the Trobriand Islands, or face internment.

32
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:14,014
I think you can guess which option he picked.

33
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:17,091
During this period, he developed the practices of participant observation

34
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:21,013
which remain a hallmark of ethnographic research to this day.

35
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:26,068
In this photograph, Malinowski is being taught to play a stringed instrument.

36
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,020
The picture of Malinowski is a wonderful illustration of what Genevieve Bell calls “Deep Hanging Out”:

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,072
By spending time with people doing their work and living their lives,

38
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:40,061
you can get beyond the surface things that people say, to learn about what they actually do.

39
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:44,066
If you’ve had lived in another country, I bet you’ve found out all sorts of things

40
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:49,020
that are normal to the people that lived there and completely unfamiliar to you.

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,051
But you don’t to go that far, or even go anywhere,

42
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:57,003
to begin to recognize the beautiful complexity of culture.

43
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:59,008
It’s all around us.

44
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:03,009
For example, being a student requires an enormous amount of practical knowledge

45
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:09,036
and constitutes a large number of practices that you enact every day and are rarely conscious of

46
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:12,098
precisely because it’s such an everyday behaviour.

47
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:16,022
But if someone were to  be suddenly  dropped into being a student,

48
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:21,003
with no knowledge of what student life was like, they’d have all sorts of trouble.

49
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:26,044
Furthermore, much like the intuitions that we’d build up when we learn to play musical instruments,

50
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:32,001
there’s all sorts of stuff that we do as part of our everyday behaviour that’s really tough to articulate.

51
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:38,068
So, what we’re going to hopefully learn by participant observation in this class is five key things:

52
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:42,097
First, what do people do now? What’s the baseline that we’re starting from?

53
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,080
Second, what values and goals do people have?

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,059
Most often we’ll want to build technologies that align with what people care about

55
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,093
and what they hope to accomplish.

56
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:54,074
And by that I don’t mean literally building what people asked for

57
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:58,053
because people often don’t know, especially for disruptive technologies.

58
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:01,066
Rather, what I’m talking about is designing technologies

59
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:05,030
that will weave themselves into the fabric of people’s everyday lives.

60
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,082
Even if they introduce new concepts and functionality.

61
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:13,086
Third, we’re going to look at how these particular activities are embedded in a larger ecology of behaviours.

62
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:20,012
For example, we might be tasked with designing a better technology for a bus or subway.

63
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:23,049
Of course, for any individual bus or subway user,

64
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:28,030
the bus or subway segment is just one piece of a larger activity —

65
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,010
like getting to a friend’s house, or commuting to work, or going to the grocery store —

66
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,090
and, by understanding the constraints and goals of that larger activity,

67
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,075
you may come up with ideas that you wouldn’t have if you were just thinking about the bus ride more narrowly,

68
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:46,053
like, “What leads somebody to select or not select the bus?”

69
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:51,073
Even if your original design brief was about improving the literal bus,

70
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:55,080
what you might end up with, as a designer, is something more broad,

71
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,004
like creating a mobile application that helps people figure out when a bus is coming or nearby,

72
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:05,073
or the best way to get from one destination to another.

73
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:09,066
Taking this broader view can help you be more effective as a designer,

74
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:13,081
by helping [you] design from the larger activity that people are engaged in.

75
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:16,039
And designing for that activity can often take you

76
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,006
away from the narrower brief that you originally began with.

77
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:24,011
Fourth, what are similarities and differences that you can find across people?

78
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:31,004
In our bus example, a low mobility user might care enormously about the accessibility of the bus.

79
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:34,060
Somebody else may be primarily concerned with costs.

80
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,011
And somebody else still may be primarily concerned with efficiency in getting there.

81
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:42,090
One of my favourite examples of participant observation

82
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,093
comes from Jack Whalen and colleagues at Xerox PARC.

83
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:51,032
They were studying a call centre for photocopier repair,

84
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:54,085
so these were people who field questions for technicians,

85
00:05:54,085 --> 00:06:00,062
and, over the telephone, help them work through troubleshooting broken photocopiers.

86
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:04,020
Doing this over the phone can be extremely difficult.

87
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,090
What Whalen and colleagues found was that, as you might expect,

88
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:13,032
the most proficient person in this copier repair centre was the person who’d been the longest.

89
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:16,077
It was the skill that they’d built up over a period of time.

90
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:23,007
What’s interesting is that the second most effective person at this repair centre was not the  person

91
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:30,031
who’d been the second longest, but rather the person who’d sat next to the person who had been the longest.

92
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:36,039
What they realized was that, by sitting next to an expert, these repair technicians were able

93
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:44,002
to pick  up all of the informal skills of doing repair work that aren’t written down in manuals anywhere.

94
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:49,093
And it’s this apprenticeship model that helped somebody really excel in their job.

95
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:55,064
One effective strategy for learning about the work  practices of your users is to apprentice yourself.

96
00:06:55,064 --> 00:07:03,055
For example, my former PhD student Ron Yeh did his dissertation on software tools for field biologists,

97
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:08,040
and as part his dissertation research, Ron in essence became a deputy field biologist.

98
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,064
He trained as a docent  up at the Jasper Ridge Preserve near Stanford,

99
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,093
and he accompanied a field biology group with them

100
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:20,006
on their field site trips to places like the Mexican rainforest.

101
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,011
So you can see another advantage of doing technology design

102
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:27,045
is you get to go to a lot of fun places too, sometimes.

103
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:31,084
Even, say, you’re interested in making a better supermarket checkout system,

104
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:37,055
you might apprentice as a clerk, and one of the things you’d learn from that is the different workarounds

105
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,088
that clerks do as part of their daily activities.

106
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:44,031
Being a good apprentice is an interactive process.

107
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:49,008
To get going, you’d want to set up a partnership with the people that you’re working with.

108
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:53,071
And, of course, you’ll probably get some formal training — that’s the process part of the job.

109
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,068
Often, that formal training includes a bunch of asides,

110
00:07:56,068 --> 00:08:00,001
if you’re getting trained by somebody who currently does that job.

111
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:03,097
And those asides are the [inaudible] that happens as part of the job.

112
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:10,024
Definitely, once you actually get involved, you’ll realize all of the everyday hacks and workarounds.

113
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:13,081
If you see something that catches your eye, it can be important to validate that

114
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:18,034
with those that you’re working with, and so you can reflect things  that you back to people,

115
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:22,035
and that can help you understand why those things are being done.

116
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:26,051
Pay attention to all of the artefacts that compose part of people’s work,

117
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:31,090
and in particular look at ways that people have hacked their equipment  to make their work  more effective.

118
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,092
One of my favourite examples of this is Post-It notes.

119
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:40,033
Think about a fax machine or some other piece of equipment that has Post-It notes all over it,

120
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,044
reminding people how to use stuff.

121
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:45,068
That’s a great example of an opportunity for innovation.

122
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:51,089
Or, for example, in my recording setup here, I have a note that I have made myself,

123
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:56,058
to turn off the DropBox files syncing software when we record.

124
00:08:56,058 --> 00:09:00,029
DropBox is a great way to keep all of the machines that we use up-to-date,

125
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:04,017
but it sometimes seems to interfere with the video recording,

126
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:06,003
so I’ve left myself a note.

127
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:10,071
You could see that as an opportunity for redesign, to, for example, turn off file syncing automatically

128
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:13,078
while  video recording is under way.

129
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,021
In particular, errors can be a real goldmine.

130
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:22,093
And what’s interesting is that often I think that when somebody can’t figure out how to use technology,

131
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:29,007
it can be [easy] to assume that it’s just ’cause they’re stupid or they don’t know  what they’re doing,

132
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:35,018
and that attitude is, I think, less pervasive than it used to be, but still quite common,

133
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:39,019
that the development team often looks down the nose of the users.

134
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,084
And one of the most effective ways I have ever seen to combat seen is in the 1980’s:

135
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:49,071
an anthropologist named Lucy Suchman worked with Xerox PARC to study photocopier usage.

136
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:52,045
And one of the things that she did was she produced a video

137
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:59,064
of two people trying to produce a double-sided copy of 50 pages of paper.

138
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:02,022
You’ll see this video here.

139
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,036
(There’s a bunch of buttons here.

140
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:10,044
So, “Output paper tray”, “Copy mode”, “1-sided”.

141
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,072
We want “2-sided copies”

142
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,032
“Unload top-paper tray”

143
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:22,013
[fast-forward gibberish]

144
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:23,091
That’s only the half of it, right?

145
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:28,015
I only got the… [inaudible]

146
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:34,049
Ok, 49 must be on the other side.

147
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,065
Hahahaha!)

148
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:40,035
This video has become a legend here in the human-computer interaction field.

149
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:43,076
We’ve just a short clip out of what’s a much longer video,

150
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:48,087
and, legend has it that when this video was shown, the executives said, well, you know,

151
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:53,048
“Those users are just dumb. They don’t know what they’re talking about. They don’t know what they’re doing.”

152
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:59,009
And, at that moment, Lucy Suchman and John Seely Brown who collaborated with her on this work,

153
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:04,044
gave their review, which is that those two users were Allen Newell and Ron Kaplan,

154
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:07,098
two of Xerox’s premier research scientists.

155
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:10,094
They were giants of computer science research, and,

156
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:14,022
in this way, you couldn’t  say it was because they didn’t know how to use technology.

157
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:19,076
All of a sudden, it made you  realize that if you are unfamiliar with a particular piece of technology,

158
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:22,080
that stuff  could be  a lot more difficult,

159
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,008
and that led Xerox to help focus more strongly on the user interface.

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,045
What we’ve talked throughout this lecture is the difference between what people say and what people do,

161
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:37,099
and I’d like to close by giving  you an example from Walmart.

162
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:41,077
A couple of years ago, in a survey, Walmart asked its customers

163
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:46,066
whether they would like the aisles to be less cluttered.

164
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:50,011
I bet you can guess what the response is: “Yes!”

165
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:54,062
I think anybody, if asked that way, would say “I’d love the aisles to be less cluttered!”

166
00:11:54,062 --> 00:12:02,013
So, very diligently, in response to the survey results that Walmart got, they decluttered their aisles.

167
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:07,050
As this news article reports, Walmart spent  hundreds of  dollars decluttering its aisles,

168
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,093
removing inventory, cleaning things up.

169
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:13,091
And what happened is that they lost a billion dollars in sales.

170
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:17,093
This seems surprising — they  did exactly what people asked. Right?

171
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:24,095
But Walmart made two mistakes that, after taking this class you’ll be able to avoid.

172
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:29,074
The first is that they paid attention to what people said, rather than what they did.

173
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:36,026
The second is that their survey asked a leading question, “Would you like the aisles less cluttered?”

174
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:39,081
Put together, this gave them a direction

175
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:44,021
that was exactly the opposite of what turned out to be the most effective.

176
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:47,044
I hope these techniques that we’ve covered today in these examples will help you

177
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:50,029
as you do your needfinding in your project assignment.

178
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:55,077
