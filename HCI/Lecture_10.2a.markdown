In this video we’re going to talk about running experiments online.
The web has offered tremendous power
in terms of being able to do experimental work,
roll out different versions of the user interface,
get feedback, and iterate quickly.
You may have heard of this under a bunch of different names:
Sometimes it is called A/B test,
or randomized experiments online,
or controlled experiments,
or split testing.
In all cases the basic idea is the same:
What you’re going to do is you’re going to
randomly split the traffic that comes to your website
between two or more versions.
So, when we talk about it as A/B testing
you’ve got your A version — which is the current live version, usually —
and you’ve got your B version —
which is usually something new that you’re trying.
And what you’re going to do
is collect metrics about how the two versions perform —
in terms of conversions, or clickthroughs,
or other things that you can measure —
and then analyze that afterwards to decide
which of your designs is more effective.
Let’s start out with an example.

Here’s a website for the National Alert Registry,
which provides information on sexual offenders.
This is the first version of the site.
Here is a second version.
And here is a third version.
In this third version it was changed to a two-column format,
and so the intuition behind that was to see
whether gettting more content above the fold on the first screen would help.
Before I show you the results,
think about which of these three user interfaces
you believe [is] the most effective
and how you might measure which of them you think works best.

You can see all three of them together.
Now what you can see is that
this third version — the two-column version —
although it was *intended* to be more much more effective —
it was a redesigned version that people hope would improve things —
what you see is that the number of sales dropped dramatically,
by more than half.
And I think this is really important,
because even the very best designers often,
when they make a revision, it gets worse.
And what the web enables us to do for the first time
is make it easy to try out something new
to get real feedback from real people
about whether that has become [an] effective change or not.
