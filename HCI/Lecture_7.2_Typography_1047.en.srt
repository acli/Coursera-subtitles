1
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:05,096
Let’s take a look at the atoms of visual design: letterforms.

2
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:09,080
This is the letter R, typeset in Gill Sans.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,000
Gill Sans was designed by Eric Gill and released in 1928.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,058
There’s a couple of things that I’d like to point out about this letter right here:

5
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:23,023
One of them is that it has the perceptual characteristic of consistent weight all throughout;

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:28,016
however, the actual thickness of the letter varies considerably over different parts.

7
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:30,099
So, if you look at some points of the letter, like the bottom,

8
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:38,000
you can see that they are much thicker than at other points in the letter.

9
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:47,048
And what you see in these atoms is exactly what you’ll see throughout the entirety of graphic design,

10
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:50,051
which is that we’re going for something that feels perceptually balanced —

11
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:56,047
or may have perceptual uniformity — when the actuality may be quite different.

12
00:00:56,047 --> 00:01:03,067
This letter was also my first assignment as a graphic design student at the Rhode Island School of Design:

13
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:09,099
We had to draw this letter, one foot high, in black paint, on a white background.

14
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:14,051
It may seem like a silly exercise, but it’s a great way to understand intimately

15
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:17,014
the curves and strokes of the letterform,

16
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:20,037
and it’s also really good at training both your eye and training your hand;

17
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:25,058
Maybe it’s also a hazing ritual that I’ve just post-hoc rationalized.

18
00:01:25,058 --> 00:01:32,002
Anyhow, moving along, let’s look at the different parts of a typeface.

19
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:38,006
One term you may be familiar with from using on your computer is the point size or the font size.

20
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,059
And what’s notable about this is

21
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:46,032
it seems like a number that ought to be set in stone and consistent across all typefaces,

22
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:48,001
but it’s really not.

23
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:53,001
Most of our terminology from typefaces come from when they were set in lead,

24
00:01:53,001 --> 00:02:00,005
and the point size of a typeface really just means the height of the lead block that the type was set in,

25
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:07,030
which has some relationship to the actual letter size, but is not completely consistent.

26
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:12,036
For example, you can see, for the same point size,

27
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:16,023
here’s a letter S in Gill Sans, and a letter S in Calibri,

28
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:25,070
and you can that the Calibri S is lower than the Gill Sans S.

29
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,001
Our second term is leading.

30
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:33,001
If we have solid blocks of lead that form the letter,

31
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:39,016
the spacing that we get between the lines was achieved by  putting thin strips of lead in between the lines,

32
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:41,097
and that was called the leading.

33
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:47,019
It’s customary to have 20% of your font size as your leading;

34
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:51,015
and so, if in your word processor you’ve set 10-point type,

35
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:59,036
it will usually automatically add an extra 2 points of spacing to put 12 points in between each line.

36
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:05,045
The height of the lowercase letters is called the x-height, from the “x”.

37
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:10,032
Some typefaces have a higher x-height, like Lucida Bright or Georgia;

38
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:14,029
other typefaces have a lower x-height, like Baskerville.

39
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:16,085
And this is important in design — especially online —

40
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:23,074
because typefaces that have a higher x-height will be easier to read at smaller point sizes

41
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:27,082
and on low resolution devices like most screens.

42
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:32,017
Conversely, typefaces with a low x-height, like Baskerville, are used

43
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:37,049
when you’re trying to give elegance, or a “bella park” feel to something.

44
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,058
And sprouting up and dropping down from the x-height are the ascenders —

45
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:45,006
like the top stem of the h and the dot of the i —,

46
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:49,098
and the descenders — like the y, p, g.

47
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:55,076
In general, a typeface that has a low x-height will tend to have long ascenders and descenders,

48
00:03:55,076 --> 00:04:05,000
and a typeface that has a tall x-height will tend to have more squashed ascenders and descenders.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,079
Typefaces can also vary in their weight.

50
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:16,013
So here have an example of light on the left, regular or roman in the middle, and bold on the right.

51
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:19,087
Sometimes you’ll see weights in between like demibold or semibold,

52
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:23,081
and, even to the further to the right of bold, you’ll see black.

53
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,094
Number six on the list are serifs.

54
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:33,070
Serifs are the doohiggies on the end of letters that give them that chiselled look.

55
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,044
[There are] a couple more that are bonus:

56
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:39,091
Some faces (typefaces) will also include small caps — which are exactly what they sound like,

57
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:42,022
smaller versions of capital[s and] numbers.

58
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:45,038
These can be used as headers, or they can also be used

59
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:50,034
to put acronyms and other capital texts inside a block of body text.

60
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:54,002
And one thing that you may not know is —

61
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:58,086
just like letters come in uppercase and lowercase, numbers do too.

62
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:01,094
These numbers, set in Neutraface,

63
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:06,027
provide an example an example of something that has just small ascenders and descenders.

64
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:09,093
In some cases these can be more dramatic.

65
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:11,037
Lowercase numbers are useful

66
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:17,001
when you want numbers to fit in with a larger block of text and not stand out.

67
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:20,048
One of the most common questions I get asked about graphic design is:

68
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:22,060
“Which typeface should I use?”

69
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,063
And a lot of people have heard a story

70
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:28,082
where serif typefaces are generally recommended for body text

71
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:32,077
and sans serif typefaces are recommended for headers.

72
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:37,048
And that’s, on the whole, not bad advice.

73
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:41,075
There is an often-repeated claim that the reason that this is a good heuristic

74
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:47,005
is because serif typefaces, with those doohiggies at the end,

75
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:52,052
give your eyes something to latch onto, and consequently they are easier to read.

76
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,054
It’s an interesting hypothesis.

77
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,007
So I looked into this a little bit for all of you,

78
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:00,082
and there’s some challenges in trying to figure this out.

79
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:07,088
For starters, individual differences in readers dwarf any manipulation effects of the typeface.

80
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:10,019
Like, some people read a whole lot faster than others.

81
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:16,033
And so it’s difficult to measure differences in the readability of typefaces.

82
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:19,081
Also, reading requires familiarity:

83
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:23,076
It’s not like we’re born knowing what a letter R looks like; we need to practice.

84
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:28,037
And so if you learn with one style of the letter R, you’ll probably be faster with that one;

85
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:33,024
and if you learn with another style of the letter R, you’ll be faster with that one.

86
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,000
If even when we got past all those challenges,

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,026
it can be a little bit difficult to figure out exactly how you should measure  this.

88
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,018
Well, I can’t go so far as to say that the serif hypothesis is definitively untrue;

89
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:53,026
what I can say is that there’s a lot of evidence to support that it actually is real.

90
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,094
And Alex Poole does a great job of describing this on his web site:

91
00:06:57,098 --> 00:07:03,047
He writes that “What initially seemed a neat dichotomous question of serif versus sans serif

92
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:07,071
has resulted in a body of research consisting of weak claims and counter-claims,

93
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:10,038
and study after study with findings of ‘no difference’.

94
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,096
Is it the case that more than one hundred years of research

95
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:16,069
has been marred by repeated methodological flaws,

96
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:21,041
or are serifs simply a typographical ‘red herring’?”

97
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:26,035
It does seem that mixed-case type like you get in a sentence — upper and lower mixed together —

98
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:29,065
is faster to read than all caps, presumably because

99
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:34,088
you get greater vertical variation with the ascenders and descenders in lowercase letters,

100
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:39,019
and that gives your eye more information as it’s reading.

101
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:45,083
Also, in general, proportional fonts seem to be faster than monospaced fonts, like a typewriter.

102
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:52,035
So, typewriter fonts — slower to read — That stuff only matters if you have to read a whole lot.

103
00:07:52,035 --> 00:08:00,085
But the simplest summary is that, in practice, legibility simply amounts to what you’re accustomed to.

104
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:03,024
What do these words say? The bottom half is obscured.

105
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:08,058
As many of you’ve guessed, “I am a jelly donut”.

106
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:12,010
How about this? Here the top half is obscured.

107
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,054
Seems a little harder?

108
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:19,027
“jfk spoke in berlin.”

109
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:25,053
Turns out that more information seems to be encoded in the top half of text than in the bottom half.

110
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:27,050
And what does this say?

111
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,026
[I] bet many of you saw it as “THE CAT”,

112
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:36,039
and fewer people, “TAE CHT”.

113
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:42,025
And that’s because expectation plays a really important role in what we read.

114
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,029
And if you’re really perceptive,

115
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:53,018
you may have realized that those two middle letters are actually exactly the same letter,

116
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:57,051
so the only difference is what you’re expecting to see in each case.

117
00:08:57,051 --> 00:09:01,055
Your prior probability influences your interpretation.

118
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:07,017
So, if you put all that together and return to our original question of “Which typeface should I use”,

119
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,078
the answer is “It depends.”

120
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:16,013
If you’re putting down a long block of text, it’s best to use a typeface will be familiar with;

121
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:21,055
and if you’re working online, use something that has a relatively high x-height.

122
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:25,084
On the other hand, if you’re making a logo or a sign,

123
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:29,046
or something that’s short and intended to be dramatic,

124
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:33,001
then you probably want to use something a little bit funkier as your typeface —

125
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:38,020
something that’s going to catch attention and be unique, memorable.

126
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,010
And typefaces — like everything in life — build up reputation.

127
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,017
So, over time, certain typefaces come to mean certain things.

128
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:51,018
And here’s a great example from Hoefler and Frere-Jones, writing on their blog.

129
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:56,033
They talk about how Baskerville seems like it’s out of a literary magazine

130
00:09:56,033 --> 00:10:03,071
and Optima seems to remind us of cheap 1950’s hygiene products.

131
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:08,009
Here are two easy exercises you can use to improve your typographical eye:

132
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:14,046
The first one is: Look around you for all of the different ways that the same typeface gets deployed;

133
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,044
that will give you a sense of its range.

134
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:21,019
The second one is: Look at how the same text,

135
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:26,046
with different typefaces, really changes its meaning.

136
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:30,033
In this class we have a lot of ground to cover quickly,

137
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:33,071
and so unfortunately we can’t spend too much time on typography;

138
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:36,056
but it’s a fascinating subject, and if you’d like to learn more about this,

139
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:42,035
there are many great books and design resources online, and they’re growing rapidly.

140
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:44,067
Here are just a few that I think are particularly good.
