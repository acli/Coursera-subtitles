1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:05,063
Let’s take a look at the atoms of visual design: letterforms.

2
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:09,069
This is the letter R, typeset in Gill Sans.

3
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:13,087
Gill Sans was designed by Eric Gill and released in 1928.

4
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:17,024
There’s a couple of things that I’d like to point out about this letter right here:

5
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:23,002
One of them is that it has the perceptual characteristic of consistent weight all throughout;

6
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:28,001
however, the actual thickness of the letter varies considerably over different parts.

7
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:31,036
So, if you look at some points of the letter, like the bottom,

8
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:38,000
you can see that they are much thicker than at other points in the letter.

9
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:47,004
And what you see in these atoms is exactly what you’ll see throughout the entirety of graphic design,

10
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:50,048
which is that we’re going for something that feels perceptually balanced —

11
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:56,052
or may have perceptual uniformity — when the actuality may be quite different.

12
00:00:56,052 --> 00:01:03,006
This letter was also my very first assignment as a graphic design student at the Rhode Island School of Design:

13
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:09,009
We had to draw this letter, one foot high, in black paint, on a white background.

14
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,052
It may seem like a silly exercise,

15
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:16,079
but it’s a great way to understand intimately the curves and strokes of the letterform,

16
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,003
and it’s also really good at training both your eye and training your hand;

17
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:25,005
Maybe it’s also a hazing ritual that I’ve just post-hoc rationalized.

18
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:32,000
Anyhow, moving along, let’s look at the different parts of a typeface.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One term you may be familiar with from using on your computer is the point size or the font size.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,005
And what’s notable about this is

21
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:46,003
it seems like a number that ought to be set in stone and consistent across all typefaces,

22
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:48,000
but it’s really not.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Most of our terminology from typefaces comes from when they were set in lead,

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and the point size of a typeface really just means the height of the lead block that the type was set in,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,003
which has some relationship to the actual letter size, but is not completely consistent.

26
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,062
For example, you can see, for the same point size,

27
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:16,002
here’s a letter S in Gill Sans, and a letter S in Calibri,

28
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:22,039
and you can that the Calibri S is lower than the Gill Sans S.

29
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:29,000
Our second term is leading.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,052
If we have solid blocks of lead type that form the letters,

31
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:39,001
the spacing that we get between the lines was achieved by  putting thin strips of lead in between the lines,

32
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:42,002
and that was called the leading.

33
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:47,001
It’s customary to have 20% of your font size as your leading;

34
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:51,001
and so, if in your word processor you’ve set 10-point type,

35
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:59,003
it will usually automatically add an extra 2 points of spacing to put 12 points in between each line.

36
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:05,004
The height of the lowercase letters is called the x-height, from the “x”.

37
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:10,003
Some typefaces have a higher x-height, like Lucida Bright or Georgia;

38
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:13,069
other typefaces have a lower x-height, like Baskerville.

39
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,008
And this is important for design — especially online —

40
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:23,007
because typefaces that have a higher x-height will be easier to read at smaller point sizes

41
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:27,055
and on low resolution devices like most screens.

42
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:31,007
Conversely, typefaces with a low x-height, like Baskerville,

43
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:37,004
are used when you’re trying to give elegance, or a “Bella Park” feel to something.

44
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,078
And sprouting up and dropping down from the x-height

45
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:44,095
are the ascenders — like the top stem of the h and the dot of the i —,

46
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:49,055
and your descenders — like the y, p, g.

47
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:55,021
In general, a typeface that has a low x-height will tend to have long ascenders and descenders,

48
00:03:55,021 --> 00:04:01,033
and a typeface that has a tall x-height will tend to have more squashed ascenders and descenders.

49
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:08,007
Typefaces can also vary in their weight.

50
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:15,045
So here have an example of light on the left, regular or roman in the middle, and bold on the right.

51
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:19,008
Sometimes you’ll see weights in between like demibold or semibold,

52
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:23,008
and, even to the further to the right of bold, you’ll see black.

53
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,009
Number six on the list are serifs.

54
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:33,006
Serifs are the doohiggies on the end of letters that give them that chiselled look.

55
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,004
[There are] a couple more that are bonus:

56
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:39,009
Some faces (typefaces) will also include small caps — which sure are exactly what they sound like,

57
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:41,076
smaller versions of capital[s and] numbers.

58
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:44,073
These can be used as headers, or they can also be used

59
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:50,003
to put acronyms and other capital texts inside a block of body text.

60
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:53,054
And one thing that you may not know is —

61
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:59,067
just like letters come in uppercase and lowercase, numbers do too.

62
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,009
These numbers, set in Neutraface,

63
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:06,002
provide an example of something that has just small ascenders and descenders;

64
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:09,046
in some cases these can be more dramatic.

65
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:11,003
Lowercase numbers are useful

66
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:17,000
when you want numbers to fit in with a larger block of text and not stand out.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,004
One of the most common questions I get asked about graphic design is:

68
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:22,006
“Which typeface should I use?”

69
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:24,006
And a lot of people have heard a story

70
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:28,008
where serif typefaces are generally recommended for body text

71
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:32,007
and sans serif typefaces are recommended for headers.

72
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:36,095
And that’s, on the whole, not bad advice.

73
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:41,064
There is an often-repeated claim that the reason that this is a good heuristic

74
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:47,000
is because serif typefaces, with those doohiggies at the end,

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,005
give your eyes something to latch onto, and consequently they’re easier to read.

76
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:55,005
It’s an interesting hypothesis.

77
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:58,000
So I looked into this a little bit for all of you,

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,008
and there’s some challenges in trying to figure this out.

79
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:07,008
For starters, individual differences in readers dwarf any manipulation effects of the typeface —

80
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:09,071
like, some people read a whole lot faster than others,

81
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:16,003
and so it’s difficult to measure differences in the readability of typefaces.

82
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:19,008
Also, reading requires familiarity:

83
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:23,007
It’s not like we’re born knowing what a letter R looks like; we need to practice.

84
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:28,003
And so if you learn with one style of the letter R, you’ll probably be faster with that one;

85
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:33,002
and if you learn with another style of the letter R, you’ll be faster with that one.

86
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:37,052
If even when we got past all those challenges,

87
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:41,002
it can be a little bit difficult to figure out exactly how you should measure  this.

88
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:48,001
Well, I can’t go so far as to say that the serif hypothesis is definitively untrue;

89
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:53,002
what I can say is that there’s a lot of evidence to support that it actually is real.

90
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:56,067
And Alex Poole does a great job of describing this on his web site:

91
00:06:57,075 --> 00:07:03,004
He writes that “What initially seemed a neat dichotomous question of serif versus sans serif

92
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:07,007
has resulted in a body of research consisting of weak claims and counter-claims,

93
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,065
and study after study with findings of ‘no difference’.

94
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:16,004
Is it the case that more than one hundred years of research has been marred by [repeated] methodological flaws,

95
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:21,004
or are serifs simply a typographical ‘red herring’?”

96
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:26,003
It does seem that mixed-case type like you get in a sentence — upper and lower mixed together —

97
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:29,077
is faster to read than all caps, presumably because

98
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:34,025
you get greater vertical variation with the ascenders and descenders in lowercase letters,

99
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:39,064
and that gives your eye more information as it’s reading.

100
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:45,008
Also, in general, proportional fonts seem to be faster than monospaced fonts, like a typewriter.

101
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:52,003
So, typewriter font[s] — slower to read — [but] that stuff only matters if you have to read a whole lot.

102
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:59,062
But the simplest summary is that, in practice, legibility simply amounts to what you’re accustomed to.

103
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:04,067
What do these words say? The bottom half is obscured.

104
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:08,099
As many of you guessed, “I am a jelly donut”.

105
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:13,047
How about this one here? Here the top half is obscured.

106
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,040
Seems a little harder?

107
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,002
“jfk spoke in berlin.”

108
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:24,071
Turns out that more information seems to be encoded in the top half of texts than in the bottom half.

109
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:27,044
And what does this say?

110
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:31,061
[I] bet many of you saw it as “THE CAT”,

111
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:36,003
and fewer people, “TAE CHT”.

112
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:42,028
And that’s because expectation plays a really important role in what we read.

113
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:44,002
And if you’re really perceptive,

114
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:52,063
you may have realized that those two middle letters are actually exactly the same letter,

115
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:57,005
so the only difference is what you’re expecting to see in each case.

116
00:08:57,005 --> 00:09:01,005
Your prior probability influences your interpretation.

117
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:07,001
So, if you put all that together and return to our original question of “Which typeface should I use”,

118
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:09,007
the answer is “It depends.”

119
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,016
If you’re putting down a long block of text,

120
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:16,035
it’s best to use a typeface that many people will be familiar with;

121
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:21,045
and if you’re working online, use something that has a relatively high x-height.

122
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:25,008
On the other hand, if you’re making a logo or a sign,

123
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:29,004
or something that’s short and intended to be dramatic,

124
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:33,000
then you probably want to use something a little bit funkier as your typeface —

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,065
something that’s going to catch attention and be unique, memorable.

126
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:42,062
And typefaces — like everything in life — [build] up reputation.

127
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:46,069
So, over time, certain typefaces come to mean certain things.

128
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:50,091
And here’s a great example from Hoefler and Frere-Jones, writing on their blog.

129
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:56,003
They talk about how Baskerville seems like it’s out of a literary magazine

130
00:09:56,003 --> 00:10:03,007
and Optima seems to remind us of cheap 1950’s hygiene products.

131
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:08,000
Here are two easy exercises you can use to improve your typographical eye:

132
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,004
The first one is: Look around you for all of the different ways that the same typeface gets deployed;

133
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:17,004
that will give you a sense of its range.

134
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:25,061
And the second one is: Look at how the same text, with different typefaces, really changes its meaning.

135
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:30,003
In this class we have a lot of ground to cover quickly,

136
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:33,007
and so unfortunately we can’t spend too much time on typography;

137
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,005
but it’s a fascinating subject, and if you’d like to learn more about this,

138
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:42,003
there are many great books and design resources online, and they’re growing rapidly.

139
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:48,000
Here are just a few that I think are particularly good.
