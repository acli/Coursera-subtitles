00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:06,039
Over the next several lectures, I'd like
to introduce you to graphic design and the

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:11,033
set of strategies for helping you
communicate more effectively, visually. To

3
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:17,018
start out with, let's look at this example
here. Some undifferentiated text. What

4
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:23,018
might we be able to do typographically to
improve this and how do we decide whether

5
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:32,049
we did well? One thing that we could is to
introduce some white space into design and

6
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:37,050
as Robert Bringhurst writes with white
space, some space must be narrow so that

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,077
others space must be wide. And some space
must be emptied so that other space maybe

8
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:48,073
filled. So, let's empty out some space and
fill up some others and we, you can see

9
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:54,023
here is by adding a little white space, we
are able to trunk the, the visual design

10
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:59,039
so that the salient bits are grouped
together and different bits are farther

11
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,021
apart. But I bet we could do more. So,
what else, what else might we'd be able to

12
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:11,030
do here? Let's explore using typographic
variation and size contrast to give some

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,001
sense of individual hierarchy and as
Edward Tufte describes it, information

14
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:21,040
consist of differences that make a
difference. So here we've done some adding

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,078
some scale and some weight, you know this
may or may not be the best design

16
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:30,079
invitation in the world but it gives you a
sense of the kind of leverage that you can

17
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,040
get by adding some typographic variation
to your design. Of course you don't want

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,030
to go overboard but I like this exercise a
lot. I got it from Jenifer Tidwell's book

19
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,079
Designing Interfaces which I highly
recommend and I was going to bring it to

20
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,070
show in this video. I have two copies but
I recommend it so often that they're both

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,077
lent out right now so you'll have to look
it up. Often, a good visual design, like

22
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:59,032
good acting or good eye glasses goes
unnoticed because the content comes

23
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:04,018
through clearly and unobstructed. Of
course sometimes we do notice good design

24
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:09,036
and good acting for its flavor or for its
ability to communicate to a certain idea.

25
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:14,022
But we notice in a different way than bad
designer, bad acting. About this line, we

26
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:18,027
noticed when we t ripped over it like
eyeglasses that are dirty, scratched and

27
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:22,037
perhaps the wrong prescription. If the
squint to make sense of things and it's

28
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:26,069
not always conscious, sometimes it is just
a little bad, it would be subconsciously

29
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,074
but we're still squinting and so a lot of
design is about trying to make the

30
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:35,035
information as matters pumped through
clearly. And to do this, I think there are

31
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:40,080
three major goals of a lot of visual
design. The first goal is to guide people

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,031
to convey the structure, the relative
importance and relationships. The second

33
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:52,080
one is to set up the phase of the
interaction to draw people in, help orient

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,019
and provide hoops to dive deep. And the
third is to use the visual design to

35
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,076
express the message of the information to
give it a meaning and style and breathe

36
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:11,082
life into the content. So think about
this, I'd like to show four homepages of

37
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:20,071
different sites. Here's the New York
Times. Google. Craigslist. And the Webby

38
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:26,071
Awards. And I think in all four cases,
each of these is really effective as using

39
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:31,083
the tools of visual design. Some more
obviously than others. Let's go through

40
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:36,074
them again, this time, I'm going to blur
each page to make the hierarchy more

41
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:41,059
salient and by emphasizing the actual
text. So, here's the new York Times

42
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:46,071
blurred out and you can see that the
overall hierarchy of the page is still

43
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:52,012
pretty clear. You could see the Heather.
The exciting image to draw you in to set

44
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:57,068
of articles, navigation along the left and
another set of navigation along the top.

45
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:03,072
Here's the Google homepage blurred and the
blur on that tells you something about the

46
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:08,056
[inaudible]. With even just a little blur,
the highlighted search and the navigation

47
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:14,025
bar disappears into the background as the
same as the rest of that bar. But that's

48
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:19,011
okay because when most people see the
screen, it probably have a good idea what

49
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:24,028
to do. In a sense, the most important part
of the topic of highlighting is to cue the

50
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:29,032
possibility of clicking on other labels to
get to other things. The Google logo on

51
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:34,024
the other hand, even with the fair amount
of blurring, stil l reads loud and clear.

52
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,097
This page is famous minimalism makes the
complicated web seem manageable. And

53
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:43,065
combine with that, the primary colors
helped to emphasize the easiness of it

54
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:49,040
all. As a little bit of trivia, here's the
original Google from when Larry Page and

55
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,081
[inaudible] were PHD students at Stanford
and about this very first hard driver, I

56
00:04:54,081 --> 00:05:00,035
got this lego bricks and I'm pretty sure
that that's where the colors in the Google

57
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:08,019
logo come from or inspired by these legos.
Here's the Craigslist homepage. A lot of

58
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:13,018
people might think I'm crazy in believing
that it has a pretty good visual design,

59
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:17,098
after all, it looks like it was built in
about 1996 and in fact it probably was

60
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:22,079
except for a little bit of updating on the
content. Another reason people often

61
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,096
criticize Craigslist is that there's a lot
of abbreviations and other things on here

62
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:33,013
which is just in general can make you feel
inelegant or clunky or design for experts

63
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:38,018
only. But a lot of Craigslist users are
repeat users and what you see here is in

64
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:43,031
the blurred version there is actually a
pretty good information hierarchy that's

65
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:48,038
conveyed. So again we can see the title up
in the top left. We can see a calendar

66
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:53,044
widget. We can see how the administration
part of things as separated off to the

67
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:58,064
left hand side also. And then we can see a
set of categorized in the middle and we

68
00:05:58,064 --> 00:06:03,057
can see we have a different kind of
navigation on the right. And the unblurred

69
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:10,034
version we can see that, that's for
cities. And here's the web year awards.

70
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:15,087
Like with all four of these pages you can
see how color is used sparingly and very

71
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:21,074
effectively. Most of the page is black and
white. The main pieces of color we see are

72
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:26,037
no lower left, there's a block of red
text, that tells you to watch the latest

73
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:30,093
[inaudible] awards. And on the top left,
we see a little bit of color for the

74
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:35,092
social media that links over the site and
again, we see the strong navigation along

75
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:40,049
the left hand side, the title in the top
left, we have the page header in the

76
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:45,053
center here and the content below it and
then, we have a major naviga tion element

77
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:51,052
along the top. When you think about it,
all four of these pages which include some

78
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:56,050
of the most highly traffic sites on the
web, are using pretty simple visual tools

79
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,043
to be able to convey organization and
hierarchy and where to dry our eye on the

80
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:05,082
page. They're using typography, they're
using layout, and they're using color. And

81
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:10,029
these are in a sense, pretty simple tools.
What continually amazes me is the power

82
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,055
that's available with these tools. Putting
this together provides the guiding,

83
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:19,013
phasing and messaging that we talked about
at the beginning. And that in turn helps

84
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:23,054
people read, navigate and make sense of
the world of information. There's a board

85
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:27,087
game, a fellow that's advertised with the
tag line, "A minute to learn, a lifetime

86
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:32,031
to master." And that applies beautifully
to visual design. You can start making use

87
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:36,026
of these principles right away and
hopefully these videos would get you
