00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:05,066
Over the next several lectures, I’d like to introduce you to graphic design

2
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:10,084
and a set of strategies for helping you communicate more effectively visually.

3
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:14,034
To start out with, let’s look at this example here:

4
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:16,077
Some undifferentiated text.

5
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:24,005
What might we be able to do typographically to improve this and how do we decide whether we did well?

6
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:31,069
One thing that we could is to introduce some white space into a design;

7
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:34,086
and as Robert Bringhurst writes, with white space,

8
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:38,036
“Some space must be narrow so that other space must be wide,

9
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:42,096
and some space must be emptied so that other space may be filled.”

10
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:46,071
So, let’s empty out some spaces and fill up some others.

11
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:53,060
And what you can see here is by adding a little white space, we are able to chunk the visual design

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,099
so that the salient bits are grouped together and different bits are further apart.

13
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:03,036
But I bet we could do more.

14
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:06,059
So, what else might we’d be able to do here?

15
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:13,001
Let’s explore using typographic variation and size contrast to give some sense of individual hierarchy

16
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:19,016
and as Edward Tufte describes it, information consists of differences that make a difference.

17
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:22,061
So here we’ve done some adding some scale and some weight —

18
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:27,095
you know, this may or may not be the best-designed invitation in the world, but it gives you a sense

19
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:33,068
of the kind of leverage that you can get by adding some typographic variation to your design.

20
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:38,024
Of course you don’t want to go overboard, but I like this exercise a lot.

21
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:42,023
I got it from Jenifer Tidwell’s book « Designing Interfaces »

22
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:45,041
which I highly recommend and I was going to bring it to show in this video.

23
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,028
I have two copies but I recommend it so often

24
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:51,084
that they’re both lent out right now so you’ll have to look it up.

25
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:57,022
Often, good visual design — like good acting or good eyeglasses —

26
00:01:57,022 --> 00:02:01,002
goes unnoticed because the content comes through clearly and unobstructed.

27
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,001
Of course, sometimes we do notice good design and good acting

28
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:09,003
for its flavor or for its ability to communicate a certain idea.

29
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,085
But we notice it in a different way than bad design and bad acting.

30
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:15,053
Bad design we notice when we trip over it.

31
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:19,026
Like eyeglasses that are dirty, scratched or have the wrong prescription,

32
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:22,070
we have to squint to make sense of things; and it’s not always conscious —

33
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,094
sometimes it is just a little bad — it would be subconsciously but we’re still squinting

34
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:32,084
and so a lot of design is about trying to make the information that matters come through clearly.

35
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:38,010
And to do this, I think there are three major goals of a lot of visual design.

36
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:46,028
The first goal is to guide people to convey the structure, the relative importance and relationships.

37
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:51,044
The second one is to set up the pase of the interaction to draw people in,

38
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:55,025
help orient and provide hooks to dive deep.

39
00:02:55,025 --> 00:03:01,053
And the third is to use the visual design to express the message of the information —

40
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:06,049
to give it some meaning and style and breathe life into the content.

41
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:12,066
So think about this, I’d like to show four homepages of different sites.

42
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,041
Here’s the New York Times.

43
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,080
Google.

44
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:18,070
Craigslist.

45
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,095
And the Webby Awards.

46
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:28,080
And I think in all four cases, each of these is really effective at using the tools of visual design,

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,046
some more obviously than others.

48
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:35,053
Let’s go through them again. This time, I’m going to blur each page

49
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:40,011
to make the hierarchy more salient and by de-emphasizing the actual text.

50
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,054
So, here’s the New York Times blurred out, and you can see

51
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:47,021
that the overall hierarchy of the page is still pretty clear.

52
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,003
You could see the header,

53
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:52,088
the exciting image to draw you in, a set of articles,

54
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:58,007
navigation along the left and another set of navigation along the top.

55
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:03,063
Here’s the Google homepage blurred and the blur on that tells you something about the saliency:

56
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:07,090
With even just a little blur, the highlighted search and the navigation bar

57
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:13,049
disappears into the background as the same as the rest of that nav bar.

58
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,072
But that’s okay because when most people see the screen, it probably have a good idea what to do.

59
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:21,075
In a sense, the most important part of the top nav highlighting

60
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:26,029
is to cue the possibility of clicking on other labels to get to other things.

61
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:32,023
The Google logo, on the other hand, even with the fair amount of blurring, stil l reads loud and clear.

62
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:37,080
This page’s famous minimalism makes the complicated web seem manageable.

63
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,070
And combine with that, the primary colors helped to emphasize the easiness of it all.

64
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,055
As a little bit of trivia, here’s the original Google

65
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:52,055
from when Larry Page and Sergey Brin were PhD students at Stanford.

66
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:55,077
They’ve built their first hard drive out of these lego bricks,

67
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:59,064
and I’m pretty sure that that’s where the colors in the Google logo come from

68
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:04,029
or inspired by these legos.

69
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,021
Here’s the Craigslist homepage.

70
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:12,003
A lot of people might think I’m crazy in believing that it has a pretty good visual design.

71
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:15,014
After all, it looks like it was built in about 1996

72
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:20,034
and in fact it probably was, except for a little bit of updating on the content.

73
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:23,084
Another reason people often criticize Craigslist is that

74
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:26,080
there’s a lot of abbreviations and other things on here

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,078
which just in general can make it feel inelegant or clunky or designed for experts only.

76
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:38,052
But a lot of Craigslist users are repeat users, and what you see here is

77
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:43,070
in the blurred version there is actually a pretty good information hierarchy that’s conveyed.

78
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,099
So again we can see the title up in the top left.

79
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,028
We can see the calendar widget.

80
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:55,033
We can see how the administration part of things is separated off to the left hand side also.

81
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:59,006
And then we can see a set of categorized content in the middle

82
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:02,004
and we can see we have a different kind of navigation on the right —

83
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:06,099
In the unblurred version we can see that that’s for cities.

84
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,003
And here’s the Webbie Awards.

85
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:16,048
Like with all four of these pages you can see how color is used sparingly and very effectively.

86
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:18,086
Most of the page is black-and-white.

87
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:22,025
The main pieces of color we see are in the lower left —

88
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:27,033
there’s a block of red text, that tells you to watch the latest Webbie Awards.

89
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:31,065
And on the top left, we see a little bit of color for the social media that links in with the site

90
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:35,065
and again, we see a strong navigation element along the left hand side,

91
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:41,051
the title in the top left, we have the page header in the center here, and the content below it,

92
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:46,043
and then we have a major navigation element along the top.

93
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:49,071
When you think about it, all four of these pages

94
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:55,058
which include some of the most highly-trafficked sites on the web, are using pretty simple visual tools

95
00:06:55,058 --> 00:07:01,057
to be able to convey organization and hierarchy and where to draw your eye on the page.

96
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:06,003
They’re using typography, they’re using layout, and they’re using color.

97
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:08,004
And these are in a sense, pretty simple tools.

98
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:11,086
What continually amazes me is the power that’s available with these tools.

99
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:17,056
Putting these together provides the guiding, pacing and messaging that we talked about at the beginning.

100
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:22,043
And that in turn helps people read, navigate and make sense of the world of information.

101
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:25,041
There’s a board game, a fellow that’s advertised with the tag line,

102
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,000
“A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.”

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,074
And that applies beautifully to visual design.

104
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:39,068
You can start making use of these principles right away, and hopefully these videos would get you started.
