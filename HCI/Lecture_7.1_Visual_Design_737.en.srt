00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:05,662
Over the next several lectures, I’d like to introduce you to graphic design 

2
00:00:05,662 --> 00:00:10,845
and the set of strategies for helping you communicate more effectively, visually.

3
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:14,348
To start out with, let’s look at this example here.

4
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,779
Some undifferentiated text.

5
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:24,059
What might we be able to do typographically to improve this and how do we decide whether we did well?

6
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:31,693
One thing that we could is to introduce some white space into design 

7
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:34,870
and as Robert Bringhurst writes with white space, 

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,840
some space must be narrow so that others space must be wide.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,965
And some space must be emptied so that other space maybe filled.

10
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:47,405
So, let’s empty out some space and fill up some others and we, 

11
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:54,023
you can see here is by adding a little white space, we are able to trunk the, the visual design 

12
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:59,999
so that the salient bits are grouped together and different bits are farther apart.

13
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,399
But I bet we could do more.

14
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,597
So, what else, what else might we’d be able to do here?

15
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:13,010
Let’s explore using typographic variation and size contrast to give some sense of individual hierarchy 

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,163
and as Edward Tufte describes it, information consist of differences that make a difference.

17
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:22,615
So here we’ve done some adding some scale and some weight, 

18
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:27,958
you know this may or may not be the best design invitation in the world but it gives you a sense 

19
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:33,689
of the kind of leverage that you can get by adding some typographic variation to your design.

20
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,244
Of course you don’t want to go overboard but I like this exercise a lot.

21
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:42,606
I got it from Jenifer Tidwell’s book Designing Interfaces which I highly recommend 

22
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:45,416
and I was going to bring it to show in this video.

23
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,281
I have two copies but I recommend it so often 

24
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,845
that they’re both lent out right now so you’ll have to look it up.

25
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:57,227
Often, a good visual design, like good acting or good eye glasses goes unnoticed 

26
00:01:57,227 --> 00:02:01,022
because the content comes through clearly and unobstructed.

27
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:04,018
Of course sometimes we do notice good design 

28
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:09,036
and good acting for its flavor or for its ability to communicate to a certain idea.

29
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:12,854
But we notice in a different way than bad designer, bad acting.

30
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:16,640
About this line, we noticed when we t ripped over it like eyeglasses 

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,737
that are dirty, scratched and perhaps the wrong prescription.

32
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:23,122
If the squint to make sense of things and it’s not always conscious, 

33
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:27,069
sometimes it is just a little bad, it would be subconsciously but we’re still squinting 

34
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,846
and so a lot of design is about trying to make the information as matters pumped through clearly.

35
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:38,101
And to do this, I think there are three major goals of a lot of visual design.

36
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:46,280
The first goal is to guide people to convey the structure, the relative importance and relationships.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,441
The second one is to set up the phase of the interaction to draw people in, 

38
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:55,259
help orient and provide hoops to dive deep.

39
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,231
And the third is to use the visual design to express the message 

40
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:06,497
of the information to give it a meaning and style and breathe life into the content.

41
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:13,329
So think about this, I’d like to show four homepages of different sites.

42
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,218
Here’s the New York Times.

43
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:17,502
Google.

44
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:18,786
Craigslist.

45
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:20,959
And the Webby Awards.

46
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,943
And I think in all four cases, each of these is really effective as using the tools of visual design.

47
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:30,439
Some more obviously than others.

48
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,675
Let’s go through them again, this time, 

49
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:39,098
I’m going to blur each page to make the hierarchy more salient and by emphasizing the actual text.

50
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:42,725
So, here’s the new York Times blurred out and you can see 

51
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:47,211
that the overall hierarchy of the page is still pretty clear.

52
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:49,035
You could see the Heather.

53
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:52,882
The exciting image to draw you in to set of articles, 

54
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:58,071
navigation along the left and another set of navigation along the top.

55
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:04,218
Here’s the Google homepage blurred and the blur on that tells you something about the [inaudible].

56
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:06,892
With even just a little blur, the highlighted search 

57
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:13,495
and the navigation bar disappears into the background as the same as the rest of that bar.

58
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:19,751
But that’s okay because when most people see the screen, it probably have a good idea what to do.

59
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:23,266
In a sense, the most important part of the topic of highlighting 

60
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:27,913
is to cue the possibility of clicking on other labels to get to other things.

61
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:34,024
The Google logo on the other hand, even with the fair amount of blurring, stil l reads loud and clear.

62
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,924
This page is famous minimalism makes the complicated web seem manageable.

63
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:43,704
And combine with that, the primary colors helped to emphasize the easiness of it all.

64
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:48,816
As a little bit of trivia, here’s the original Google from when Larry Page 

65
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:53,865
and [inaudible] were PHD students at Stanford and about this very first hard driver, 

66
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:58,983
I got this lego bricks and I’m pretty sure that that’s where the colors 

67
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:04,291
in the Google logo come from or inspired by these legos.

68
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,217
Here’s the Craigslist homepage.

69
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:13,018
A lot of people might think I’m crazy in believing that it has a pretty good visual design, 

70
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:15,608
after all, it looks like it was built in about 1996 

71
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:20,345
and in fact it probably was except for a little bit of updating on the content.

72
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:24,587
Another reason people often criticize Craigslist is that there’s a lot 

73
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:27,804
of abbreviations and other things on here which is just 

74
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:33,781
in general can make you feel inelegant or clunky or design for experts only.

75
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:37,813
But a lot of Craigslist users are repeat users and what you see here is 

76
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:43,921
in the blurred version there is actually a pretty good information hierarchy that’s conveyed.

77
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,769
So again we can see the title up in the top left.

78
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,838
We can see a calendar widget.

79
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:54,524
We can see how the administration part of things as separated off to the left hand side also.

80
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:57,669
And then we can see a set of categorized in the middle 

81
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,044
and we can see we have a different kind of navigation on the right.

82
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:06,996
And the unblurred version we can see that, that’s for cities.

83
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:10,034
And here’s the web year awards.

84
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:16,480
Like with all four of these pages you can see how color is used sparingly and very effectively.

85
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,868
Most of the page is black and white.

86
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:22,254
The main pieces of color we see are no lower left, 

87
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:27,333
there’s a block of red text, that tells you to watch the latest [inaudible] awards.

88
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,889
And on the top left, we see a little bit of color for the social media 

89
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,328
that links over the site and again, we see the strong navigation along the left hand side, 

90
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:42,639
the title in the top left, we have the page header in the center here and the content below it and then, 

91
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,433
we have a major naviga tion element along the top.

92
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:51,052
When you think about it, all four of these pages which include some 

93
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:56,050
of the most highly traffic sites on the web, are using pretty simple visual tools 

94
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,579
to be able to convey organization and hierarchy and where to dry our eye on the page.

95
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:04,929
They’re using typography, they’re using layout, and they’re using color.

96
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,802
And these are in a sense, pretty simple tools.

97
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,866
What continually amazes me is the power that’s available with these tools.

98
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:17,969
Putting this together provides the guiding, phasing and messaging that we talked about at the beginning.

99
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:22,440
And that in turn helps people read, navigate and make sense of the world of information.

100
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,417
There’s a board game, a fellow that’s advertised with the tag line, 

101
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:28,002
“A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.”

102
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:30,747
And that applies beautifully to visual design.

103
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:36,026
You can start making use of these principles right away and hopefully these videos would get you
