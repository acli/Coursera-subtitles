1
00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:05,080
In addition to participant observation and structured interviews,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,063
there are other ways that you can forage for design insights.

3
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:13,082
For example, what do you do when the behaviour that you are interested in

4
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:19,076
happens over a long period of time, or is sporadic, or both?

5
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:22,007
Interviews are hard for the same reason.

6
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:28,019
One effective solution in places like this is for the participant to do the capturing themselves.

7
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:34,034
One common class of technique for doing this is what I call diary studies.

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:41,019
In this technique, you give people a diary that they complete at a specific time or interval,

9
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:45,022
for example every evening or at every meal.

10
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:51,042
In general, diary studies are used to record a specific piece of information,

11
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:55,044
like “how happy you feel” or “what you ate.”

12
00:00:55,044 --> 00:01:00,004
Often the diary has some sort of structure to help you complete that efficiently.

13
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:06,063
You can use normal old paper, text journals; you can use still or video cameras;

14
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:11,086
you can have audio recording — whatever is appropriate for the task that you’re trying to capture.

15
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:15,029
In selecting from among the different media that you can use for capturing,

16
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:23,022
like video versus audio versus text versus photos; analog versus digital; pay attention to the context.

17
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:26,068
If you’ll like to capture information about somebody’s mobile phone,

18
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:32,014
maybe you’d give them a piece of paper with some structure on it, like a couple of scales

19
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:37,083
that they’d keep with them on their phone, so, that way, whenever they pull out their phone,

20
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:42,055
the diary entry that you’d like them to fill out is right there with it too.

21
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:50,048
In some cases, an audio recorder will be the easiest way to get people to actually record information

22
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:54,047
at the relevant time, like maybe if somebody’s driving.

23
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:59,046
In other cases, like during a lecture, speaking out loud might be inappropriate,

24
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:03,007
and so you’ll want to have somebody have marks on paper.

25
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:09,075
One of the appealing features of diary studies is that they can scale a lot better than direct observation.

26
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:16,037
Direct observation is limited by the amount of time that you can spend with the participants;

27
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:21,006
with a diary study, you’re only limited by the amount of materials that you can give out

28
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:23,078
or that you can aggregate later on.

29
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:28,063
The most important piece of design for creating an effective diary study

30
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:33,001
is to have the entry be as frictionless as possible.

31
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:38,031
The easier it is for participants to mark down the information that you’re interested in,

32
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:41,040
the higher quality the results that you’re going to get.

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,074
With a diary study, like any user interface, the results that you’ll get will be best

34
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:50,042
if you offered people some training and some practice.

35
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:56,069
Also, any time you’re changing people’s behaviour, like asking them to record into a diary,

36
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,067
they’ll do it for a while, and then it’s easy to fall off the wagon and forget,

37
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:04,033
and so you may want to follow up with people and remind them,

38
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:08,070
and that reminding brings us to our next technique, which is called “experience sampling.”

39
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:15,017
The idea behind experience sampling is to “beep” people at some regular interval,

40
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:19,080
and have them write down a key piece of information at that time.

41
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,017
Sometimes these are also called “pager studies”,

42
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:26,072
because many of the early studies in the 80’s and 90’s used pagers,

43
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:33,000
and an appeal of doing a pager study is that the participants don’t need to remember

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,032
because you’re actively reminding them.

45
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:38,022
They’re often coupled with some kind of diary,

46
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:41,057
so the paper beeps — or now it might be your mobile phone —

47
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:44,059
and then there’s a structured form that you’d fill in.

48
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:48,064
And these are, again, used for things like “How happy do you feel?”,

49
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:51,044
“What’s your energy level?”, “Where are you?”

50
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:57,053
Sometimes these take the form of a psychometric scale; other times these are more open-ended questions.

51
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:02,040
On the research front, technologies like wireless sensor networks are expanding the possibilities

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,059
for what the triggers can be

53
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:08,051
and for what kinds of information can be automatically or semi-automatically recorded.

54
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:15,084
Experience sampling, like diary studies, is useful for aggregating information across lots of people,

55
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:19,081
like, “Are there times of day that make people more or less happy?”

56
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:27,001
It’s easiest for you, as the researcher, if this information can be filled in in some digital form,

57
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:31,021
like a survey, so it can be automatically aggregated.

58
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:36,083
But sometimes, for practical reasons, paper will be the most ubiquitous tool out there,

59
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:42,000
and in that case, go with whatever you can to get people to actually fill it out.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,091
In the techniques that we’ve talked about so far,

61
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:49,017
it’s the designer that ultimately comes up with the design ideas,

62
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:54,051
and the user’s behaviour serves as the father for that ideation.

63
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:58,034
Users can also be a great source of design ideas themselves,

64
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:01,045
especially advanced users or “lead users”.

65
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:07,002
And Eric von Hippel at MIT has been the champion of this approach for several decades.

66
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:09,012
He’s in the left of this picture,

67
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:14,012
and he’s hanging out with Dr. Nathaniel Sims at Mass. General Hospital at Boston.

68
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,051
Dr. Sims is an anesthesiologist.

69
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:19,035
Like almost anybody in almost any work environment,

70
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:23,011
he finds some of the tools that he has to use frustrating.

71
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:25,097
But he went one step further than most:

72
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:30,057
For example, when he needed to carry around a number of different medical devices,

73
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:36,045
he created for himself a carrying rack that could easily hold all of them at once,

74
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:39,049
so they can be moved around the hospital more efficiently.

75
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:44,011
He’s picked up several patents for his work over his career, including this device here,

76
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,072
which is called the “Nat rack”.

77
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:50,061
Lead users in all sorts of domains come up with clever solutions,

78
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:56,037
and one role of designers is to help lead users turn their individual solutions

79
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:59,036
into something that’s more generally useful.

80
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:05,013
And, in this way, lead users become a sort of distributed creation engine

81
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:08,049
who can collaborate with designers to bring products to market.

82
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:14,091
Lead user innovation works best when the reason that there’s not a better solution out there

83
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:21,000
is primarily because designers don’t understand what the user needs are,

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,048
or the context is shifting really rapidly.

85
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:27,064
And so, for example, Eric von Hippel has shown how

86
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:33,000
in places like surfng and snowboarding or other extreme sports that move quickly,

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,074
changing your equipment is not all that difficult, but things are fast-paced,

88
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:44,020
and so, to be able to do new tricks, people will modify their equipment to suit their needs.

89
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,012
Lead user innovation works less well when the necessary piece of information

90
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:53,090
is some kind of process knowledge, or a better factory, or something like that.

91
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,043
Related to lead users are what we might call “extreme users”.

92
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,023
Think about something like email.

93
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:05,017
All of us get a lot of email, but some of us get a lot more than others.

94
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:09,062
Those people who get a whole lot of email, far more than the average person,

95
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,043
they’re extreme users from the vantage point of email.

96
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:16,074
And we can often learn things from those extreme users —

97
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:20,025
how they handle thousands of messages a day, for example —

98
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:26,074
that we might then be able to encapsulate and make available to all users and help everyone.

99
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:30,035
Extreme users can be extreme in almost any direction,

100
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:35,094
and so people who have interesting professions are often a good source for extreme users.

101
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:41,077
One can be an extreme as a technophile, or one might be an extreme as a technophobe.

102
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:47,026
And so the person in the log cabin in Vermont, who checks email once a month,

103
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:56,028
might be as useful an extreme user as the CEO in Silicon Valley who gets thousands of messages a day.

104
00:07:56,028 --> 00:08:04,086
While lead users and extreme users can often provide valuable design ideas  that transfer more broadly,

105
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:10,091
it’s not automatically the case, and, in fact, sometimes the extreme users are extreme

106
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:14,018
because they’re not the actual users.

107
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:18,033
Make sure you keep in mind the actual people that you’re designing for.

108
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:22,045
You do all this great design work at the beginning to learn what users need.

109
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:27,006
How do you keep their needs in mind throughout the entire design process?

110
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:31,055
How do you not lose track of these insights that you captured early on?

111
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:38,047
One great strategy for distilling the insights from participant observation, or interviews,

112
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:43,008
diary studies, experience sampling — any of the techniques you choose —

113
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:52,042
is to create from those insights “personas”, who are abstract users who represent what you’ve found

114
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:55,038
when you went out and looked at real users.

115
00:08:55,038 --> 00:09:00,014
So, a persona is a model of a person; they’re an example.

116
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:04,040
They’re not any one human being, but they are concrete.

117
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,030
So, a persona is going to include demographic information, and also their motivation —

118
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,082
Why do they want to use the system that you’re creating? What would make them not use it?

119
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:21,028
What are their beliefs? What are their intentions? What are their behaviours? and what are their goals?

120
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:29,090
What often happens in a design process is that one design member of the team want to build something,

121
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:36,072
and so they’ll make up a story about why that particular thing might be useful to somebody.

122
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:41,050
A persona keeps you grounded. You can say, “How would Steve use this?”

123
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:48,046
or, “Would this additional feature fit with Steve’s desire for a minimalist system?”

124
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:53,066
To make these personas real, it’s nice to have a picture or a photo.

125
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:59,062
In fact you can use stock photography, or one of the photographs from your needfinding

126
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:01,094
to anchor that persona visually.

127
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:06,078
Make sure to give your persona a name, give them an occupation, and a background.

128
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:11,022
They should have some hopes and dreams. Give them a story to tell.

129
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:14,069
They should really come alive and feel like a real human being.

130
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:21,028
It’s easier to be empathic towards a particular person than a generic one,

131
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,020
and that’s how personas help:

132
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,013
By knowing what a persona thinks, does, and feels, it helps you build empathy;

133
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:32,054
it helps you understand the states of mind, the emotions, the philosophy,

134
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:35,058
the beliefs, the point of view of that user.

135
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:41,056
Personas also keep designs coherent and consistent over time,

136
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:45,025
rather than a scattered-shot agglomeration of features.

137
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:52,036
And, perhaps most importantly, the empathy that you’d build by designing for a particular persona

138
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:56,004
can often lead to insights that you wouldn’t otherwise have,

139
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:58,096
and this gives you new design opportunities

140
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:03,097
and can help you be more innovative than existing solutions that are out there.

141
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:10,052
We’ve talked about several strategies for engaging the people to come out with new design ideas.

142
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:16,068
This is the best way that I know how to reliably come up with innovative ideas.

143
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:21,080
But that doesn’t mean that every single design has to work this way —

144
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,050
every design process has to work this way —

145
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,000
and it doesn’t mean that, automatically, if you failed to follow this design process,

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,063
then your design is automatically bad.

147
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:37,066
It’s not like, if your startup goes public, the SEC, on its filing forms will ask you

148
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:41,015
“Did you follow a rigorous needfinding process?”

149
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:44,080
Ultimately, what people are excited about is the design,

150
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:51,090
and all I’m offering here is a set of tools that will help you, with the best odds that I know of,

151
00:11:51,090 --> 99:59:59,000
give you as as great a design as you can get.
