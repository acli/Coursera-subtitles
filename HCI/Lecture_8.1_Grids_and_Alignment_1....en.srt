00:00:01,058 --> 00:00:04,010
In this video we’re going to talk about designing with grids

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,068
and using grouping and alignment to convey structure.

3
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:15,019
Here’s an example of a grid: This comes from Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines,

4
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,008
and it’s annotated by Sun and it’s [a] web resource.

5
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,040
This is a Find dialog box, and what you can see is that

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,017
all of the elements in the dialog box have been arranged using a grid.

7
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:31,038
And what we mean by a grid is that there’s a set of invisible lines

8
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:34,021
that all of the elements on the screen snap to.

9
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:38,038
So you can that the top of the dialog box is the Find and then the search area,

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,038
and then below that are all of the parameters,

11
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:45,097
and below that still are the Find and Close buttons.

12
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:49,059
You’ll notice that the left edge of the parameters lines up with the left edge of the search box,

13
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:54,010
and the right edge of the buttons lines up with the right edge of the search box.

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,078
You’ll also notice that the Find, which is the title of the dialog box,

15
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:03,044
is hanging off to the left, so that it’s easy to identify the title.

16
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:06,033
You can see that the most important information is near the top,

17
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,081
and how things that are conceptually more related —

18
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:15,040
like the parameters that parametrizes the search system — are closer to each other than the buttons —

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,056
still part of the same dialog box but a little further apart — and so they get more space.

20
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:25,071
It was at the Bauhaus in Germany in the 1920’s

21
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:33,056
that the strategies for designing with grids really came into their own.

22
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:36,052
The Bauhaus, at the time, was a revolutionary design school,

23
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:41,050
and their graphic designer, Jan Tschichold, wrote this book, called « The New Typography »

24
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,045
to outlay his vision for modern graphic design.

25
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:50,058
It espouses asymmetric typography, sans serif typefaces,

26
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:54,091
and a lot of other things that we’ve come to think of as Modernism.

27
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,066
One thing that’s notable about Tschichold’s book on typography

28
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,074
is that it reads like a political manifesto:

29
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:04,066
He really had this belief that he was changing what design meant for the world,

30
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:09,068
stripping it of all of its excess and distilling it down to its bare elements.

31
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,049
You may or may not elect to follow its principles;

32
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:19,057
some of these ideas now seem a little bit reductive, or overly didactic, or too moralizing;

33
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:22,078
but there’s a lot in here that’s tremendously useful.

34
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:29,047
And this picture is me at the Bauhaus a couple of summers ago.

35
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:33,098
So there’s a number of parts that compose a grid system. The main one is a set of columns —

36
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:37,043
in this case they’re of equal width, but they don’t necessarily need to be.

37
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:43,067
And the second piece is a set of gutters, which is the whitespace in between the columns.

38
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:50,011
In addition to that, things are generally horizontally aligned using a baseline.

39
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,083
You can add text hierarchically — So here we see a title, and a subtitle,

40
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:59,086
or maybe a byline or something like that.

41
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:02,081
And there’s no need for the grids to all be of equal width.

42
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:08,060
So here’s a mockup, for example, of a narrow left-hand column that you might use for navigation,

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:19,005
and then a wide central column that may have the body article or main content of a page.

44
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:24,064
Grids are used widely in newspapers, in books, and on the web.

45
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:30,085
Here’s an example of Myspace, which the home page right now is a strongly-gridded design,

46
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:37,033
and you can see a nice combination of pictures and text on its home page.

47
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:42,062
Here you can see the Stanford homepage, and the invisible grid undergirds this whole structure.

48
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:47,034
But that doesn’t mean that everything is one-column wide all the way down.

49
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:53,013
One thing that I like about this page is that different elements punch across multiple columns.

50
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:58,006
And you can also see how this five-column grid goes across *almost* the entire page:

51
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:01,034
You can see how the navigation at the top has five columns;

52
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:05,016
the Stanford logo is centred on the first two of those columns;

53
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:11,074
and those five columns travel down throughout the major whitespace part of the page.

54
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:15,085
The grid is broken somewhat at the bottom, with the footer.

55
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:23,041
Here is the New York Times homepage where, again, you can see a five-column grid for the content,

56
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:31,066
with a sixth column for navigation on the left-hand side.

57
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:35,043
You can see how those five columns invisibly travel the entire page,

58
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:39,000
and that some of the content in the middle, for example, is two columns wide,

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,030
and which parts are two columns wide vary across the page,

60
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:52,090
and so that makes it a little bit more dynamic, so it doesn’t feel too rote and too boring.

61
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,064
Newspapers have benefitted from grid systems and really pushed the envelope on it for a long time

62
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:02,081
so [we] saw a couple of the New York Times to give you a sense of the different ways that they use grids.

63
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:08,088
Here’s an example that combines both text and pictures.

64
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:15,078
Here you can see a “focus plus context” view, where the most recent article at the top is biggest,

65
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:20,078
and the lower articles down are smaller.

66
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:25,040
Here’s an example of a grid on the New York Times homepage that’s far below the fold,

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,053
showing sections and then articles within each section,

68
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:33,075
with a small thumbnail picture for each of the sections.

69
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:36,048
A grid doesn’t have to be non-overlapping:

70
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:42,026
You can have different rows of content on a page adhere to different grids —

71
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,074
often they’ll have some relationship to each other.

72
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:48,085
So I made a quick mockup here, where we have six elements in two rows,

73
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:54,085
and the grid is staggered.

74
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:56,083
When you’ve content that comes in multiple pieces —

75
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,054
for example titles of classes and course numbers —

76
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:04,029
how should you organize them so that they work well together and are easy to read?

77
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,077
I’m surprised by how frequently books will take some content like this

78
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:14,032
and put these dots — or somehow they’ll separate the two pieces.

79
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:19,034
It’s obviously not impossible to read, but I think we can do better.

80
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:24,018
Here’s an example where we have right-aligned the smaller element —

81
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:29,040
which could be page numbers, or course numbers, or date, or something like that —

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,037
and then we’ve left-aligned the larger element — which is the title or some other larger piece of text.

83
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:40,012
The other thing that we’ve done here is we’ve changed the weight of the typeface

84
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:44,047
so that the number is a different weight from the text.

85
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:50,018
Now, which one is heavy and which one is light? It depends on which one you want to emphasize.

86
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:54,065
Here, the course name is probably more important — that’s what you’re going to scan first —

87
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:57,063
and then when you want to sign up, you may need to find the course number,

88
00:06:57,063 --> 00:07:02,091
and so that’s a lighter weight because that’s what you’ll use second.

89
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:06,025
If you have three pieces of text — for example if you add an instructor name —,

90
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,087
you can offset that typographically.

91
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:12,041
Here’s just an example of adding it over to the right.

92
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,052
Adding a third column can make things a little bit confusing;

93
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:20,022
[but] depending on your content, that can work too.

94
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,039
Another strategy, of course, is you could put that third element on a separate line.

95
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,050
Here we see the instructors listed below the course number.

96
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,026
And if you’re going to do this, have the stuff that chunks together be closer together,

97
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,064
and the separate chunks be further apart.

98
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:36,058
So, what we’re looking at right now is that the leading —

99
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:39,056
the inter-line spacing between every line — is identical,

100
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:46,085
and that’s sub-optimal, because that’s less clear which element the instructor name goes with.

101
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:49,037
If we add a little bit of space in between our elements,

102
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:53,076
it becomes clear which instructor groups with which course.

103
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:59,076
You can also see a tradeoff here, where, by having two lines per course, it reads very clearly,

104
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:05,038
but we’re using up more vertical space — maybe less horizontal space.

105
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,097
Depending on which screen space or print space you’re laying out into,

106
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:13,044
that will change your design decisions.

107
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:16,059
Another thing that we might do if we really want to de-emphasize course numbers

108
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:29,067
is scale back the grey value of that number, to make them recede further.

109
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:32,086
One quick tip is: when you’re creating systems like this,

110
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:36,042
make sure to work with the longest block of text first.

111
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,056
It can be easy to design for a short title

112
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:43,033
and then have a grid or alignment system that breaks down when you get to something longer.

113
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:47,011
This is especially true if you’re designing for multiple different languages.

114
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:51,006
For example, German text often consumes a lot more real estate

115
00:08:51,006 --> 00:09:01,037
than English or Spanish or French text does.

116
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:03,074
We’re going to see examples of different alignment styles

117
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:07,028
and when they work in different circumstances in this lecture.

118
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:12,051
In general, a high-order rule of thumb is that for left-to-right–reading languages,

119
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:18,006
left-aligned text is the fastest for skimming.

120
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:22,010
And you can see that here: I’m taken the same content and centred it,

121
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,039
and I’ve left all the tabs in, so that’s why you get the crazy ragging.

122
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,083
It looks kind of cool, actually, and if you’re going for dynamism, this might work pretty well.

123
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,055
However, if you wanted to be able to quickly scan things,

124
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:39,097
this will be a little bit slower than if everything is aligned.

125
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:47,098
Here’s an example of one common design strategy, where “everything is centred.”

126
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:52,094
And you can, of course, get the information off of this page [when] you need to;

127
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:56,067
but the centring makes it hard to scan for the things that you need.

128
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,095
Also, there’s a lot of chart junk on this page —

129
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:04,027
so the boxes around the overview and the publications are pretty unnecessary

130
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:08,020
and makes it slower for your eye to get to the things that you need to.

131
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,014
If this page were designed using a grid, and the chart junk eliminated,

132
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:19,053
then the content itself would move to the fore more strongly.

133
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:25,042
So, to sum up, using alignment well helps guide your eye and reduce clutter.

134
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:31,046
Avoid slight misalignments, because they undermine your ability to beacon the organization.

135
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:36,019
We automatically notice patterns and also deviations from them,

136
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,039
and so use patterns when you want to convey consistency,

137
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:46,092
and deviate from them only when you intentionally want to distinguish that content.

138
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:50,022
If your deviation from the pattern is accidental or laziness,

139
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:57,068
it will leap out to the eye and distract from the message that you’re trying to get across.

140
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:02,088
And you use visual proximity — keeping chunks close together and self-contained,

141
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:07,081
and separating chunks further apart — to distinguish what the elements are.

142
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:11,062
And you can use scale and hierarchy — making the important things bigger

143
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:15,093
and the less important things smaller or scaled back in colour —

144
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:28,053
as a way of emphasizing what the more and less important parts of the page are.

145
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:33,052
So, when are some examples of when you might use different alignments for different purposes?

146
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:38,033
We have a nice example on Amazon’s web site.

147
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:43,002
Amazon actually has different parts of their site that they use different kinds of alignment for.

148
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:47,019
And you can see the first example here, where in the “Add an address” dialog box,

149
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:54,020
the form is aligned so that all of the labels are right-aligned and that the entry fields are left-aligned to that,

150
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:01,042
so you get this clear gutter, like what we saw in our courses and titles example.

151
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:07,037
This makes what you need to fill out extremely clear.

152
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:11,025
Here, on the Account page, you can see all of the labels are left-aligned.

153
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:14,033
This page also offers a nice exampleof visual hierarcy,

154
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,070
where the key piece of the label is very large,

155
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,035
and the sub-header — which explains in a little more detail — is much smaller

156
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:26,037
and is also scaled back in grey value.

157
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:31,008
And finally, on the right-hand side of this very same page, we can see an example of top alignment,

158
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:36,059
where the headers for the form are above the form cell.

159
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:45,087
And this diversity is not because three different Amazon designers made three different parts

160
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:49,020
and they never coordinated — or at least I assumed that’s not the case.

161
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:55,053
My hunch is that Amazon decided strategically what the most important part of each element was,

162
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:59,084
and how to make clear to the viewer what they should pay attention to:

163
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,051
For things that we’re familiar with,

164
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:05,027
the headers may be less important than for things that we’re unfamiliar with.

165
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:11,024
So, for sign-in, the headers need to stick out less, whereas for the aspects for our account,

166
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:18,010
which we may go to less frequently as a page element, we need to have that stick out more.

167
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,069
In this introductory course, we won’t have a chance to talk much about colour,

168
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:24,062
but I’d want to say a little bit here.

169
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:30,006
The first and most important thing to say about colour is: Pay attention to it!

170
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:36,039
And if I can give you one strategy for using colour effectively, it’s to design in greyscale first.

171
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:41,051
Often people rely on colour as a crutch for making visual distinctions in designs,

172
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:47,095
and, really, you’ll want to use the other tools first:

173
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:56,006
Start up by working with scale and layout as ways of distinguishing elements on the page.

174
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:59,042
Then, once you’ve used scale and layout as much as you can,

175
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:03,086
you can use luminence as a way of indicating what’s more and less imortant —

176
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:07,063
luminence is just a fancy word for grey value, so if you’re designing in greyscale,

177
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:14,048
that means some stuff is black, some stuff is grey, some stuff is white.

178
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:19,009
And once you’ve got the best design that you can in greyscale — in black and white —,

179
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:26,061
then add colour as a way of giving it an additional redundant coding for salience.

180
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:31,061
To use Amazon as an example again, here’s one of their search results pages in greyscale.

181
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:33,075
And you can see that all of the information that you need

182
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:36,057
is clearly set up in terms of the visual order of the page —

183
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:43,041
what elements are larger, what elements are smaller.

184
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:49,081
So the whole thing works in greyscale — in black-and-white —, but if you add colour, it gets even better.

185
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:53,020
And that, I think, is the most effective way to use colour.

186
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:59,090
The other thing to say about colour that I think is useful is: By and large, don’t overdo it!

187
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:07,016
All things equal, fewer colours is generally more powerful and less overwhelming than more.

188
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,085
This is obviously going to depend on your taste,

189
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:13,057
and this is obviously going to depend on what you’re trying to convey.

190
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:16,028
Again from the Java Look and Feel Guidelines,

191
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:21,076
here’s an example of how this version of Java used six colours —

192
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:24,033
three shades of grey, three shades of purple —

193
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:31,011
as a way of organizing all of the elements in their widget library.

194
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:37,046
One way that they used colour is that anything that you could click on was some shade of purple,

195
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:41,051
and anything that you couldn’t click on was some shade of grey.

196
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:44,047
And that provides a nice organizing characteristic,

197
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:49,005
and gives a sense to the user of what they can do when they see a particular screen.

198
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:53,051
And because colour is used so consistently — colour means clickable —

199
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:58,096
it’s really easy to learn, even if subconsciously.

200
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:04,057
And I’d like to close with this example of a book. Here’s the first page of Umberto Eco’s book,

201
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:08,072
« The Island of the Day Before », and it’s a beautifully typeset book.

202
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:11,022
I’d like to point out a couple of things about this book.

203
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:16,001
For starters, there’s a quotation from a diary that’s at the beginning of the page

204
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:20,025
that’s set off in italic to show that it’s different.

205
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:25,091
Then, each chapter begins with a couple of words of text in small caps,

206
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:30,010
and there’s a good amount of space above that line of text.

207
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,038
And finally, there’s a lot of whitespace around the text in general,

208
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:38,071
and providing whitespace is important.

209
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:43,010
Books and texts that have a little bit of room around them are easier to read

210
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,009
than ones that are jam-packed out to the edges of the margins.

211
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:51,073
That’s one reason why you’ll see hard covers have more whitespace than cheaper paperbacks.

212
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:55,064
In the paperback case, they’re trying to save pulp to make it a lower price;

213
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:59,088
but the hard covers, which they can charge a little more for, offer more room

214
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:05,033
and are easier on the eyes to read.

215
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,066
If you’re interested in learning more about grids and alignment,

216
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:11,003
there’s a lot of great books out there; [but] there’s a couple that I recommend:

217
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:16,049
One is Jan Tschichold’s classic, « The New Typography ».

218
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:21,088
Another is Kevin Mullet and Darrel Sano’s « Designing Visual Interfaces ».

219
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:26,024
And a third is Luke Wroblewski’s « Web Form Design »;

220
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:34,084
this is one of the Rosenfeld books, and this whole series is excellent in terms of its HCI.
