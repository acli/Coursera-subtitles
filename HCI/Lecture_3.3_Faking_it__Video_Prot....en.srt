1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:05,039
One of the most important elements of
human-centered design is making sure that

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:10,001
all the different design choices you make.
What functionality is available and what

3
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,091
interface elements, information
architecture and visual design present

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:18,069
that functionality harmoniously combine to
fluidly support the activities that matter

5
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:23,006
to people, that are using your system. I
bet that a lot of the systems that you

6
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:27,049
find most inspiring benefit from this
coherent, user-centered approach, and that

7
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:31,092
a lot of the interfaces that you find
frustrating lack this coherence and feel

8
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:36,042
jumbled. Achieving this harmony can be
difficult because it's easy to get sucked

9
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:41,086
into implementation details, and miss the
forest for the trees. One of the best ways

10
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:47,001
of ensuring that coherent, human-centered
vision drives your design and your design

11
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:51,085
team is to create a video prototype
showing what you imagine it'll be like to

12
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:57,022
use your system. It's also a lot of fun.
>> To give you a sense of what I mean by

13
00:00:57,022 --> 00:00:59,052
this I'd like to show you a video
prototype that the walkabout team created

14
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:01,089
at Stanford. >> [inaudible] Go. With the
flip of a button [inaudible] walkabout

15
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:07,008
[inaudible] motion [inaudible] on her
iPhone. It's time to go With a click of a

16
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:13,095
button; Karissa sets walk-about in motion
on her iPhone. She doesn't have a lot of

17
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:18,043
time for exercise in her day, but she
likes to stay healthy by walking to and

18
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:23,020
from her destinations. She's got a couple
minutes before her bus comes, so she sits

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,079
down to check her walkabout progress.
Walkabout counts the steps that she makes

20
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,050
in her everyday life and converts them
into a personal journey. Carissa is taking

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:38,078
a personal journey up Mount Everest. She's
at 28,000 feet, about to reach the Hillary

22
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:45,002
Step, and she decides to take a look
around. Ryan's feeling competitive. He

23
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:51,000
pulls up Walk-about and challenges his
friend Brendon to a walk-off. Whoever gets

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,071
the most steps by the end of the day wins.
Brendan decides he's ready to accept the

25
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:03,092
challenge. As he heads off to his next
class, he has to decide whether or not

26
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:09,047
he's going to take the elev ator. He
checks his walkabout competition and sees

27
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:15,046
that Ryan is in the lead. Brendan heads up
the stairs. Should Ryan take the long way

28
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:21,009
to work, or the short way? With more at
stake than there used to be, he sets off.

29
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:27,051
Carissa checks her phone; she's been
invited to a step off for Obama. She's

30
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:34,014
happy to track her steps for a good cause.
Ryan's also been invited to the step off,

31
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:40,096
he decides to join too. Everyone's steps
are accumulated cooperatively. >> Joining

32
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:47,075
up is a no-brainer for Brendon. He decides
to post a group walk-about status on his

33
00:02:47,075 --> 00:03:00,093
Facebook page. >> Walk about. Small steps
can lead to big change and big fun. Video

34
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:06,009
prototypes offer four really important
benefits for your design process. First,

35
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:12,046
they can be really cheap and fast to make.
Second, they serve as great communication

36
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:17,010
tools. Among other things, it's a
wonderful way of showing the context of

37
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,033
use, so that your entire design team can
get on that same page And because it's a

38
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:27,029
standalone video, it's an explanation of
your design ideas that's completely

39
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:32,074
portable and that anybody, anytime can
call up and look at. I also really like

40
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:37,035
using video prototypes as a spec for a
development team where you can say any

41
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:42,031
interface that accomplishes this goal is a
good interface. And theses video can make

42
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:46,092
the interface design decisions come alive
a lot more than a written long word

43
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:51,065
documentation [laugh] And finally, video
prototypes force you to tie all of your

44
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:56,017
interface design decisions to actual user
tasks. This helps you align, orient, and

45
00:03:56,017 --> 00:04:00,048
prioritize your interface choices And it
makes sure you have a complete interface.

46
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:04,069
Do you have all of the elements that
somebody would need to accomplish the task

47
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:09,006
that they'd like to And also that there's
nothing extra. In the development process

48
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:13,021
it's really easy to find all sorts of
bells, and whistles, and shiny things that

49
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:17,063
you want to be able to add into the system
And if it ultimately doesn't help people

50
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:22,005
accomplish goals, a video prototype can be
a great way to remind yourself that maybe

51
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:26,092
it's best to leave it out. You can use
video prototyping throughout your design

52
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:31,028
life cycle. Really early on when your
first just starting to think around ideas,

53
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:35,048
you can use video prototypes as a
brainstorming aid, and these can take just

54
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:39,078
a few minutes. You can take paper
prototypes that you've built and in an

55
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:44,046
hour or two put together a video really
quickly. Or, if you have a design idea

56
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:49,020
that you really need to get a lot of
support behind from a large organization

57
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,064
to sell something to management or
investors, you can make a really slick

58
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:58,056
video prototype as a way of selling and
explaining your ideas. A great example of

59
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:03,054
this is Apple's Knowledge Navigator which
twenty years ago introduced a number of

60
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:08,068
ideas for a vision of a future smarter,
more adaptive user interface And while it

61
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:13,022
can be appealing to try channel your inner
Steven Spielberg and make a big budget

62
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:17,077
epic film, a lot of my favorite uses of
video prototypes comes early in the design

63
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:22,031
process, where you're using video as a way
of communicating to the design team, and

64
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:26,075
debating design ideas And in a lot of
cases, you'll use your paper prototypes as

65
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:31,029
an interface that the video prototype is
elaborating on. Here's a great example of

66
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,056
that, that Lisa Seaman made when she was
working on a smart energy monitoring

67
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:41,065
system at Stanford. Abby Dinkenspiel is an
economics professor at Stanford. She cares

68
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:45,097
about her energy usage, but it's not to
the extent of her actions. She receives a

69
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:50,013
monthly energy bill, but there's little
information about which activities or

70
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:54,061
devices consume the most energy. She wants
to be able to identify problem spots and

71
00:05:54,061 --> 00:06:02,023
correct them as fast as possible. Using
her home monitoring system Abby's able to

72
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:06,054
see how much electricity each of her
appliances is using. Starting in the

73
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:11,038
kitchen she's able to compare the usage of
each of her appliances to the national

74
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,075
average. She's also able to look at the
other rooms of the house, check her

75
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:24,069
progress statistics, and talk to her
energy saving buddy. Through the console,

76
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:29,007
she is able to look at other rooms in her
house. The house schematic shows where ea

77
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:33,018
ch of her appliances is located. She is
also able to individually target rooms

78
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:37,021
like the library, bathroom, bedroom and
living room to see how much energy is

79
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:41,024
using in each. She's able to select one,
such as the bathroom and control the

80
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:45,064
devices. Here she can set the shower time,
so that the hot water will gradually turn

81
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:49,067
off after ten minutes. Abby is also able
to check her home monitoring system

82
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:53,092
remotely while she is in the office. She
can go to a personal website and access.

83
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:58,078
Vice info, check her progress, and chat
with her energy saving buddy. She's also

84
00:06:58,078 --> 00:07:03,054
able to control her devices via Smartphone
in case she happens to leave the lights on

85
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:08,070
or the air conditioning. [sound] With
access to neighborhood consumption

86
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,055
patterns, consumers can accurately compare
their energy consumption to their

87
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:16,065
neighbors. Neighborhoods can ban together
in the fight to reduce their collective

88
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:22,017
carbon footprint. Another energy-saving
tool is the buddy system, where you enlist

89
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:26,052
a friend, colleague, or online friend to
save energy together. This is a good way

90
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:37,042
to check progress and motivate each other
in a positive yet competitive way. So what

91
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:42,018
do you put in a video prototype? Like a
story board, you want to make sure that

92
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:47,012
the video prototype shows the entire task.
Including the out print motivation, and

93
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:51,045
the success outcome at the end
Establishing shots and narrative at the

94
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:56,027
beginning can really help with this For
example in the walkabout video, Carissa

95
00:07:56,027 --> 00:08:00,091
begins by saying, it's time to go. That
introduces the task She needs to head

96
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:05,074
somewhere, and walkabout is reminding her
to walk. Video prototypes are also a great

97
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:10,013
time for you to take what you learned in
the field and put it to use. Draw on the

98
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:14,058
tasks that you observed and elaborate on
them when making your prototype. When you

99
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:18,093
think about the task that you want your
system to perform especially well Those

100
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:23,043
are things that you should showcase in the
video prototype, and in this way a video

101
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:27,082
prototype is a great way of figuring out
what your minimal viable product is for

102
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:32,046
something you'll want to release In the
video, in the minimum viable product. Not

103
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:37,005
in the video, doesn't need to be in the
first round. As you can see in making

104
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:42,007
these prototypes, you're making important
and consequential design decisions And in

105
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:46,060
this way, making and viewing these
prototypes changes what the design teams

106
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,009
argue about and I think do so in a really
good way. Alright, you're on board and

107
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:55,020
ready to go. How do you do it? Well the
first thing to do, like anything, start

108
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,048
with an outline. Plan out your shots, what
the video prototype is going to show and

109
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:03,086
how the tasks will accomplish that. You
can use the story boards that you made to

110
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:07,096
help you do that, those will be really
valuable here. It's also fine to

111
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:13,051
extemporize. Turn on the camera. Make up a
bunch of stuff. See what happens. Don't

112
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:17,079
worry about a fancy camera. It doesn't
matter. It's not that important And in

113
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,096
fact, fancy gadgets can often be a
distraction here because it's; it's easy

114
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:26,058
to spend a lot of time on the production
side of things. If you, or anyone you know

115
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:31,003
has a, a camera phone you've got the
equipment that you need probably to make a

116
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,045
video prototype. The other main
ingredients you'll need of course are

117
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:38,026
people, get your friends to be actors or
you can be actors yourself. Great way to

118
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:41,096
build to build empathy with the people
that'll use your system And you need a

119
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:45,096
real location. Its fun to shoot these out
in the world, or wherever you think people

120
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:50,089
will be, be using your system And I can't
emphasize enough how the goal of a video

121
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:55,078
prototype is really about the message and
story that you're trying to get across,

122
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,060
and not about high production values
Because it really is easy to spend far too

123
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,000
long on that. When planning your
prototype, think about a couple of things.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,089
One of the most important ones is are you
going to make it with audio, or make it

125
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,059
silent movie style? A big advantage of
having it be silent movie style, is that

126
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:20,026
audio can just be a pain to deal with. You
can make title cards on sheets of paper at

127
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:25,045
home, so, you can use these to title the
scenes And you can also use things li ke

128
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:29,063
Post-It Notes to communicate stuff about
your users. So give people a name tag that

129
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:33,087
has their name, or role, or something that
the audience ought to know about what they

130
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,005
care about. As we talked about, the
interface can be anything you want. You

131
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:42,043
can make a paper prototype, or digital
mock-ups. Or if you have code, go with

132
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:46,076
that. Or the interface can even be
invisible. So for example, if I was going

133
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:51,043
to build a presentation tool interface,
you could show me working at this tablet

134
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:56,017
right here, without actually showing any
of what I see on the screen, and I really

135
00:10:56,017 --> 00:11:00,043
like that as a strategy because it
absolutely emphasizes what the person

136
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:05,017
using the system can accomplish And then
later, you can think about well, what U I

137
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:09,078
would we need to enable them to do that?
And finally, if I can give you one tip

138
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:14,065
that will make this a whole lot more fun
and save you a whole lot more time, edit

139
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:19,033
as little as possible because editing is
hugely time consuming. My TA for this

140
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:24,007
class, Robbie, knows that far too well. If
you can, do the whole thing in one take

141
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:29,011
And if that's not reasonable just use the
pause button in your camera to be able to

142
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:33,040
do your in camera editing And you're off
and running, For more information, see

143
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,055
Wendy Mackay's material. She's done a lot
of work on video prototyping over the

144
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:41,085
years and has a lot of great suggestions.
I'd also like to thank her because a lot

145
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:46,010
of the stuff that I shared with you today
is based on her teaching of this stuff

146
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,036
over the years. Have fun!
