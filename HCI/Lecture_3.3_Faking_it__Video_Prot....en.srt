1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,091
One of the most important elements of human-centered design

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:07,012
is making sure that all the different design choices you make —

3
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:11,004
what functionality is available and what interface elements, information architecture,

4
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:14,020
and visual design [that] present that functionality

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,089
harmoniously combine to fluidly support  the activities that matter to people that are using your system.

6
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:27,021
I bet that a lot of the systems that you find most inspiring benefit from this coherent, user-centered approach,

7
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:32,071
and that a lot of the interfaces that you find frustrating lack this coherence and feel jumbled.

8
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,035
Achieving this harmony can be difficult

9
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:40,032
because it’s easy to get sucked into implementation details and miss the forest for the trees.

10
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:47,010
One of the best ways of ensuring that a coherent, human-centered vision drives your design and your design team

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,025
is to create a video prototype showing what you imagine it’ll be like to use your system.

12
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:55,008
It’s also a lot of fun.

13
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:58,002
To give you a sense of what I mean by this,

14
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:03,037
I’d like to show you a video prototype that the walkabout team created at Stanford.

15
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:05,095
(It’s time to go!

16
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:12,025
With the click of a button, Carissa sets Walkabout in motion on her iPhone.

17
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:15,028
She doesn’t have a lot of time for exercise in her day,

18
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:19,018
but she likes to stay healthy by walking to and from her destinations.

19
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:21,044
She’s got a couple of minutes before the bus comes,

20
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:24,095
so she sits down to check her Walkabout progress.

21
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:30,072
Walkabout counts the steps that she makes in her everyday life and converts them into a personal journey.

22
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:35,005
Carissa is taking a personal journey up Mount Everest.

23
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:38,033
She’s at 28,000 feet, about to reach the Hillary Step,

24
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:41,087
and she decides to take a look around.

25
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:44,089
Ryan’s feeling competitive.

26
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:49,098
He pulls up Walkabout and challenges his friend Brendon to a walk-off:

27
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:54,062
Whoever gets the most steps by the end of the day wins.

28
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:59,092
Brendon decides he’s ready to accept the challenge.

29
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:06,021
As he heads off to his next class, he has to decide whether or not he’s going to take the elevator.

30
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:10,034
He checks his Walkabout competition and sees that Ryan is in the lead.

31
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:13,067
Brendon heads up the stairs.

32
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:17,015
Should Ryan take the long way to work, or the short way?

33
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:21,053
With more at stake than there used to be, he sets off.

34
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:26,097
Carissa checks her phone: She’s been invited to a step-off for Obama.

35
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:30,057
She’s happy to track her steps for a good cause.

36
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:36,000
Ryan’s also been invited to the step-off; he decides to join too.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,005
Everyone’s steps are accumulated cooperatively.

38
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,001
Joining up is a no-brainer for Brendon.

39
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:48,046
He decides to post a group Walkabout status on his Facebook page.

40
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:53,086
Walkabout: Small steps can lead to big change and big fun!

41
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,053

42
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,050
Video prototypes offer four really important benefits for your design process.

43
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,082
First, they can be really cheap and fast to make.

44
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:12,096
Second, they serve as great communication tools.

45
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:16,080
Among other things, it’s a wonderful way of showing the context of use,

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,063
so that your entire design team can get on that same page.

47
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:26,090
And because it’s a standalone video, it’s an explanation of your design ideas that’s completely portable

48
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,081
and that anybody, anytime can call up and look at.

49
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:35,014
I also really like using video prototypes as a spec for a development team

50
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:39,065
where you can say “any interface that accomplishes this goal is a good interface.”

51
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:43,015
And these videos can make the interface design decisions come alive

52
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:47,039
a lot more than a written long-word documentation.

53
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,097
And finally, video prototypes force you to tie all of your interface design decisions to actual user tasks.

54
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:58,049
This helps you align, orient, and prioritize your interface choices.

55
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,056
And it makes sure you have a complete interface:

56
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:05,082
Do you have all of the elements that somebody would need to accomplish the task that they’d like to?

57
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:07,086
and also that there’s nothing extra?

58
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:10,019
In the development process it’s really easy to find

59
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,082
all sorts of bells and whistles and shiny things that you want to be able to add into the system.

60
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:17,054
And if it ultimately doesn’t help people accomplish goals,

61
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:23,070
a video prototype can be a great way to remind yourself that maybe it’s best to leave it out.

62
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,069
You can use video prototyping throughout your design lifecycle.

63
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:31,012
Really early on, when you’re first just starting to think around ideas,

64
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:36,025
you can use video prototypes as a brainstorming aid, and these can take just a few minutes.

65
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:43,031
You can take paper prototypes that you’ve built and, in an hour or two, put together a video really quickly.

66
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,003
Or, if you have a design idea

67
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:49,034
that you really need to get a lot of support behind from a large organization

68
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:51,075
to sell something to management or investors,

69
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:57,088
you can make a really slick video prototype as a way of selling and explaining your ideas.

70
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,061
A great example of this is Apple’s Knowledge Navigator

71
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:08,005
which, 20 years ago, introduced a number of ideas for a vision of a future smarter, more adaptive user interface.

72
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:13,027
And while it can be appealing to try and channel your inner Steven Spielberg and make a big-budget epic film,

73
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:17,024
a lot of my favorite uses of video prototypes comes early in the design process,

74
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:22,050
where you’re using video as a way of communicating to the design team and debating design ideas.

75
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:29,061
And in a lot of cases, you’ll use your paper prototypes as the interface that the video prototype is elaborating on.

76
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:32,005
Here’s a great example of that that Lisa Seaman made

77
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:35,092
when she was working on a smart energy-monitoring system at Stanford.

78
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:41,034
(Abby Dinkenspiel is an economics professor at Stanford.

79
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:45,001
She cares about her energy usage, but it’s not to the extent of her actions.

80
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:47,004
She receives a monthly energy bill,

81
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:51,037
but there’s little information about which activities or devices consume the most energy.

82
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:56,029
She wants to be able to identify problem spots and correct them as best as possible.

83
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:05,081
Using her home monitoring system, Abby’s able to see how much electricity each of her appliances is using.

84
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:11,043
Starting in the kitchen, she’s able to compare the usage of each of her appliances to the national average.

85
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:16,022
She’s also able to look at the other rooms of the house, check her progress statistics,

86
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:20,037
and talk to her energy-saving buddy.

87
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:27,036
Through the console, she is able to look at other rooms in her house.

88
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:30,067
The house schematic shows where each of her appliances is located.

89
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:35,061
She is also able to individually target rooms like the library, bathroom, bedroom and living room

90
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,051
to see how much energy she is using in each.

91
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:42,031
She’s able to select one — such as the bathroom — and control the devices.

92
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:46,085
Here she can set the shower time, so that the hot water will gradually turn off after ten minutes.

93
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:51,072
Abby is also able to check her home monitoring system remotely while she is in the office.

94
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:57,054
She can go to a personal website and access device info, check her progress, and chat with her energy saving buddy.

95
00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:01,051
She’s also able to control her devices via a smartphone

96
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:05,089
in case she happens to leave the lights on or the air conditioning.

97
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,055
With access to neighborhood consumption patterns,

98
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:12,042
consumers can accurately compare their energy consumption to their neighbors.

99
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:17,099
Neighborhoods can band together in the fight to reduce their collective carbon footprint.

100
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,012
Another energy-saving tool is the buddy system,

101
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:24,083
where you enlist a friend, colleague, or online friend to save energy together.

102
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:30,032
This is a good way to check progress and motivate each other in a positive yet competitive way.

103
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:36,012
Stanford University / Initiative for a Sustainable Future)

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,019
So what do you put in a video prototype?

105
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,052
Like a storyboard, you’ll want to make sure that the video prototype shows the entire task,

106
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:50,004
including the upfront motivation, and the success outcome at the end.

107
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:53,038
Establishing shots and narrative at the beginning can really help with this.

108
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,024
For example, in the Walkabout video, Carissa begins by saying, “it’s time to go.”

109
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:03,028
That introduces the task: She needs to head somewhere, and Walkabout is reminding her to walk.

110
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:09,000
Video prototypes are also a great time for you to take what you learned in the field and put it to use.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,072
Draw on the tasks that you observed and elaborate on them when making your prototype.

112
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:17,065
When you think about the task that you want your system to perform especially well,

113
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:20,098
those are things that you should showcase in the video prototype.

114
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:24,015
And in this way a video prototype is a great way

115
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:29,079
of figuring out what your minimal viable product is for something you’ll want to release —

116
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,081
In the video, in the minimum viable product;

117
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:35,086
Not in the video, doesn’t need to be in the first round.

118
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:40,079
As you can see in making these prototypes, you’re making important and consequential design decisions.

119
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:44,009
And in this way — making and viewing these prototypes —

120
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:49,073
changes what the design teams argue about and I think do so in a really good way.

121
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:51,079
Alright, you’re on board and ready to go.

122
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:53,028
How do you do it?

123
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:56,079
Well the first thing to do, like anything, start with an outline.

124
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:02,021
Plan out your shots, what the video prototype is going to show and how the tasks will accomplish that.

125
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:06,044
You can use the storyboards that you’d made to help you do that; those will be really valuable here.

126
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:08,051
It’s also fine to extemporize.

127
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:12,093
Turn on the camera. Make up a bunch of stuff. See what happens.

128
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,086
Don’t worry about a fancy camera: It doesn’t matter; It’s not that important.

129
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:20,063
And in fact, fancy gadgets can often be a distraction here,

130
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:24,037
because it’s easy to spend a lot of time on the production side of things.

131
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:27,063
If you, or anyone you know, has a a camera phone,

132
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:32,003
you’ve got the equipment that you need probably to make a video prototype.

133
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:34,052
The other main ingredients you’ll need of course are people:

134
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:37,059
Get your friends to be actors or you can be actors yourself.

135
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:41,005
Great way to build to build empathy with the people that’ll use your system.

136
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:42,040
And you’ll need a real location.

137
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,070
Its fun to shoot these out in the world, or wherever you think people will be using your system.

138
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,003
And I can’t emphasize enough how the goal of a video prototype

139
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:56,070
is really about the message and story that you’re trying to get across, and not about high production values,

140
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,055
because it really is easy to spend far too long on that.

141
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:03,059
When planning your prototype, think about a couple of things:

142
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,078
One of the most important ones is:

143
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:10,034
Are you going to make it with audio, or make it silent movie style?

144
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:16,072
A big advantage of having it be silent movie style, is that audio can just be a pain to deal with.

145
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:23,097
You can make title cards on sheets of paper at home, so, you can use these to title the scenes.

146
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:27,073
And you can also use things like Post-It notes to communicate stuff about your users —

147
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:31,017
so, give people a name tag that has their name, or role,

148
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:34,042
or something that the audience ought to know about what they care about.

149
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,094
As we talked about, the interface can be anything you want —

150
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:43,006
You can make a paper prototype, or digital mockups; or, if you have code, go with that;

151
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:45,029
or the interface can even be invisible.

152
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,035
So for example, if I was going to build a presentation tool interface,

153
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:54,094
you could show me working at this tablet right here, without actually showing any of what I see on the screen,

154
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:56,077
and I really like that as a strategy

155
00:10:56,077 --> 00:11:01,082
because it absolutely emphasizes what the person using the system can accomplish.

156
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:07,071
And then later, you can think about  “What UI would we need to enable them to do that?”

157
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:13,058
And finally, if I can give you one tip that will make this a whole lot more fun and save you a whole lot more time:

158
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:19,010
Edit as little as possible because editing is hugely time-consuming.

159
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,031
My TA for this class, Robbie, knows that far too well.

160
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:25,062
If you can, do the whole thing in one take, and if that’s not reasonable,

161
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:30,022
just use the pause button in your camera to be able to do your in-camera editing,

162
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,003
and you’re off and running.

163
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:34,069
For more information, see Wendy Mackay’s material.

164
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:39,039
She’s done a lot of work on video prototyping over the years and has a lot of great suggestions.

165
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,050
I’d also like to thank her because a lot of the stuff that I shared with you today

166
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,064
is based on her teaching of this stuff over the years.

167
00:11:45,065 --> 99:59:59,000
Have fun!
