1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:08,006
In this video, we're going to talk about
Assigning Participants to Conditions. And

2
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:12,005
one of the most basic questions you can
ask about this is, should every

3
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:15,068
participant use every alternative? To
illustrate this, we're going to walk

4
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:20,007
through an example and we're going to see
the trade-offs that are intrinsic to

5
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:25,002
different approaches you can take here. In
this study, we're going to compare a smart

6
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:37,002
vacuum cleaner, with a more traditional
vacuum cleaner. As you remember from last

7
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:42,007
time, one of the first questions we should
ask about this are, what are the measures?

8
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:47,004
Do we want something that is, faster or,
cleaner or, less fatigue, better

9
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:52,004
ergonomics, lower environmental impact,
portability, ease of use, fewer errors.

10
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:57,008
Any of these are valid measures, you might
even keep track of them all. For our

11
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:03,001
example here though, we're, we're going to
pick two. We're going to go with faster,

12
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:08,001
and we're going to go with cleaner. So,
our manipulation is going to be vacuum

13
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:13,006
type and our measures are going to be
speed and cleanliness. To help illustrate

14
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:18,063
this example, I'm going to recruit the
help of my graduate students and TAs and

15
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:25,001
so here they are. One thing that you can
imagine is that you've assigned half of

16
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:30,008
them to each condition. That's called a,
between subjects design and so we could

17
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:37,005
assign half of them to the robot
interface. And we can assign half of them

18
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:44,002
to the traditional interface. So, Chinmi,
Nicolas and Alex get the robot and Dan,

19
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:51,003
Ranjitha and Jesse get the traditional
one. And let's say for example, that the

20
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:56,087
robotic interface performs better, faster,
cleaner. With only six people, it's hard

21
00:01:56,087 --> 00:02:02,006
to say whether it's because the vacuum
cleaner there is better or whether the

22
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:07,007
three people we happened to assign to it
Chinmi, Nicholas and Alex were better

23
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:11,054
cleaners than Dan, Jesse, and Ranjitha.
So, the other strategy is that within

24
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:16,048
subjects design where we could have
everybody use both interfaces. Probably

25
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:23,000
going to use first. If they use the old
interface first, they've gotten practice

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,003
and they may be extra good or maybe tired
when t hey get to use the new one and

27
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:33,008
vice-versa .So, between subjects designs,
have a worry about individual differences,

28
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:38,057
within subjects designs, have a worry
about ordering effects. Is there some way

29
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:44,045
we can get the best of both worlds? Well,
how might we address these ordering

30
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:49,077
effects? Well, one thing we can do is we
can take half the people and have them try

31
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:55,007
one interface first. And the other part
and try the other interface first.

32
00:02:57,004 --> 00:03:02,001
Counter-balancing has a couple of nice
properties. For starters, you can treat it

33
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:06,008
as completely a between subjects design if
you look at only the first task that

34
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:13,002
people do. And hopefully, the benefit that
you get from practicing or the detriment

35
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:18,008
of fatique is roughly the same in both
conditions and it'll even itself out. And

36
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:24,006
so, counter balancing washes out some of
those concerns. There are times where this

37
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:29,054
isn't the case and that's a great time to
use between subjects design. To minimize

38
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:33,057
learning effects, it's probably best to
make the first and second tasks different.

39
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:37,050
So in this case, we might have people
clean the D school as their first task and

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,046
clean the Gates building as their second.
This also has the added benefit of giving

41
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:45,084
us some more Ecological validity by trying
out a couple of different environments so

42
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:49,080
we know it's not just the Gates building
that's better cleaned by robots. It also

43
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,024
has the benefit that both the D school and
the Gates building are clean. How about

44
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:59,080
individual differences? Should we try to
balance for shirt color, hair length,

45
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,096
gender, or whether the picture in their
icon is squarish or more rectangular? It

46
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:09,084
depends on whether you think it's gonna
make a difference in the study or whether

47
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:14,024
one might plausibly believe that it would
make a difference in the study. Simplest

48
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:18,071
thing to do, is truly random assignment,
we'll talk about more sophisticated

49
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,088
techniques in a couple of slides. Okay, so
now we know a couple of ways of dealing

50
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:26,099
with two different alternatives, what if
we have three? With three alternatives,

51
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:31,007
you can use something called a Latin
Square. I'l l explain how this works in

52
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:36,068
three conditions, it generalizes more. In
a classic Latin Square design, each person

53
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:41,059
is going to use all three conditions.
You'll randomly divide your participants

54
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:46,099
up into three different groups. The first
group is going to get the first one first,

55
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:52,053
the second one second and the third one
third. The second group 231, and the third

56
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:57,057
one 312. So again, everybody gets all
three conditions, but their order changes.

57
00:04:57,057 --> 00:05:03,040
And if you look at any particular ordering
segment, so like what people see first

58
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,014
what people see second what people see
third, you can see that, that is also

59
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:12,056
evenly balanced across the three
conditions. Whether you choose between

60
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:17,044
subjects approach or a within subjects
approach. The most important thing to do

61
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:22,007
is to make sure that the odds that any
particular participant ends up in a

62
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:27,004
particular condition or particular
condition ordering is completely random

63
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:32,002
is, is even. We can illustrate this with
an example. Say you wanted to find out

64
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:37,004
whether people were faster typing in the
morning or typing in the afternoon and you

65
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:42,002
allow people to come in whenever they
want. What if people who have a preference

66
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:45,066
for the morning, morning people are faster
typers than people who have a preference

67
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:50,003
for the afternoon? Your conclusion is that
morning would be, that morning was faster.

68
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:53,084
But that's not right, because just the
morning people were faster, not that

69
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:57,097
there's something about the, the morning,
or maybe not, you can't say confound. It's

70
00:05:57,097 --> 00:06:02,006
possible that the causal reason was
population difference and not experimental

71
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:06,011
manipulation. This confound is why a lot
of economics is so hard. You're computing

72
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:10,046
correlations, but there's no manipulation.
Random assignment is tool number one in

73
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:15,043
achieving a, an effective manipulation. So
in our typing case, you would want to

74
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:20,031
assign people to be in either the morning
condition or in the afternoon condition.

75
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,079
The morning and afternoon example can seem
kind of stylized, but it shows up a lot in

76
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,082
the real world. For example, if you're
running a website, one easy thing y ou

77
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:33,046
might do is show everybody one alternative
on one day and one alternative on the

78
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:37,080
next. Well, there may be a difference
between those days. We'll talk more about

79
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,063
running experiments later on. But for now
I, wanted to point out that the key is if

80
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:46,084
you're going to do something like this
make sure that people are randomly

81
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:52,030
assigned. Easiest way in most cases is a,
is a between subjects design where you

82
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:58,008
assign people as they come in to see
either one interface or the other. Here's

83
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:03,035
another example of the importance of
random assignment. In the 1930's, some

84
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:09,010
studies were run at the Western Electric
Factory outside Chicago, called Hawthorne.

85
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,025
And the plan was pretty simple, find out
whether changes in lighting levels

86
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:19,070
affected productivity. So, experimenters
came in, raised the lighting levels,

87
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,064
productivity goes up. Then, they tried
lowering the light levels, productivity

88
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:28,071
went up. Tried a whole bunch of
combinations, after each intervention,

89
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:33,024
productivity went up. The conclusion of
course is that it's the active intervening

90
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:37,092
rather than that the light levels itself,
which was the major cause behind the

91
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:42,055
productivity change. Presumably either the
workers felt like people cared about them,

92
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:47,038
or the excitement of the experiment, or
whatever. That was the driving factor. In

93
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,085
recent years, some economists have
questioned whether in fact there was a

94
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:56,081
Hawthorne effect at the Hawthorne plant.
If you're curious, you can Google more

95
00:07:56,081 --> 00:08:01,077
about that. In either case, the name stuck
and it means a case where what you're

96
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:06,069
seeing is your effect as a result of the
intervention rather than the thing you

97
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:11,069
were trying to study, and you can avoid
this with random assignment. We've talked

98
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,077
about counterbalancing the order of
conditions that participants experience.

99
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:20,062
You can also counterbalance how you assign
people the conditions. Say for example,

100
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:24,055
you are worried that typing speed will
differentially affect something in your,

101
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:29,003
in your interface. You're building a new
spreadsheet or something like that. You

102
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:34,006
could use a pretest to establish typing s
peed ahead of time and use that to assign

103
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:39,002
people to conditions. There's many
techniques for doing this. The simplest

104
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:43,007
way to do it is just look at high,
high-speed typers versus low-speed typers.

105
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:48,002
The key, no matter what, is that each
participant has an equal chance of ending

106
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:53,002
up in either condition. Let's walk through
an example. If you can pretest everyone

107
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:57,006
ahead of time, one slick thing that you
can do is form matched pairs. So, say we

108
00:08:57,006 --> 00:09:03,007
get the typing speeds that we see here and
after ordering they look like this. We can

109
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:09,000
group them into pairs, and then for each
pair we can conceptually flip a coin about

110
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,001
which of them is going to land in which of
the two conditions. I got one of these

111
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:19,001
dollar coins in the ticket machine the
other day, it will do well for flipping,

112
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:29,071
so for a 35 and 37, it's heads. So, we'll
put 35 down here, in the first condition,

113
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:43,037
37 goes in the second. And for 57 versus
59, it's tails, so 59 goes here. Third

114
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:58,006
one's heads, so that gives us 61, 68. And
tails, and that gives us 99 goes here and

115
00:09:58,006 --> 00:10:04,004
70 goes here. By doing this matched pairs,
you're balancing out the performance of

116
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:10,001
people approximately in each condition and
by having some randomness in there, you're

117
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:15,021
ensuring that you don't get some
accidental statistical artifacts that

118
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:20,095
creep in by saying assign all your odds
here and all your evens there. But say

119
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:25,079
people are coming in online so you can't
pretest people for the experiment. Well

120
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,075
what you can do, is you can pick some
threshold that you think is in about the

121
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:34,074
middle. So, for typing you might say 65
words a minute. And as people come in, you

122
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:41,074
can check whether they're above or below
that threshold and label them as high,

123
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:48,078
high or low, fast or slow typers based on
that. So, 35 we would say is low, 40 is

124
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:56,080
low, 90 is high, 68 is high and so on.
And, you can assign them to your two

125
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:11,057
different conditions, call them A and B by
high and low. So, our first low person to

126
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:19,099
come in 35, tails, so they go to B. And
then to balance that out 40 we would go

127
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:26,013
heads. Next time we got a pair of l ows,
we can flip the coin again and we're going

128
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:31,099
to do that for the highs also. So, the
highs come in and heads. So, our first

129
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:38,094
high will go to A and our second high will
go to B. You don't need to make sure that

130
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:43,056
you have even numbers of high and low
typers, unless you're worried about that,

131
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:47,068
making a material difference on the, on
the outcome. In fact, if you have enough

132
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:52,002
participants, you can look at this two by
two grid and compare the outcomes on the

133
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:56,055
four cells. What you do need to make sure,
is that there are the same number of fast

134
00:11:56,055 --> 00:12:01,066
typers of high in A and in B and the same
numbers of slow typers are low in A and in

135
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:06,055
B. There's lots of ways that you can do
this kind of counterbalancing. In general,

136
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:10,095
all of them are treating the same thing
which is try and help the law of large

137
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:15,033
numbers that you get in a between subjects
study, work a little bit faster. Now,

138
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:21,014
there's a danger of assigning people based
on a pretest that I would like to warn you

139
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:26,053
about. Say, we wanted to pretest for coins
that were more likely to come up heads.

140
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:38,029
So, I have some coins here. I can flip
each of these a couple of times, heads,

141
00:12:38,029 --> 00:13:25,056
tails. Okay, that one was heads more. So,
it's really heads more. Tails. Yes. That

142
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:51,080
was tails. Heads. And tails. So, we have
three coins that had a heady tendency and

143
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:59,098
three coins that had a taily tendency. Now
we can feed them a snack so we can get a

144
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:07,013
bagel. In fact, this is the same bagel
that's in the last lecture so with bagels

145
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:12,099
so it's, it's not such a fresh bagel
anymore but nonetheless, we think it'll

146
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:19,078
give our coin some sustinance so we can
each eat some of the bagel and we want to

147
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:27,048
see whether our heady coins become more so
and whether our taily coins become more

148
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:32,071
so. So, I think by the natural tendency of
these coins is in one direction by feeding

149
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:36,072
them, I, I think that may make them more
so. So, the question that we're going to

150
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:41,032
ask, is whether snacking increases the
natural tendency of coins. And we can

151
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:46,054
re-flip all of these and I, I won't
inflict that on you right now. But you can

152
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:51,063
try it yourself. And what you'll see of
course is that, none of these coins really

153
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:56,025
had a tendency towards heads or tails,
it's just that on a small number of

154
00:14:56,025 --> 00:15:00,020
samples, you know, if you came out little
bit with more heads, if you came out

155
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,009
little bit with more tails. And if you
flip them again, there will be no

156
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:07,006
correlation between their heady tendency
in the first half and heady tendency in

157
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:12,066
the second half. To make it a little more
exciting than just the six coins that I

158
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:19,003
had in my pocket, I decided to generate 30
coins in Excel and I flipped them each 21

159
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:24,093
times and you can see the results here of
how many heads each got out of 21 tosses.

160
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:30,095
I picked an odd number so they would have
to be either heady or taily on the whole.

161
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:37,049
And what we can see if we rank them by
number, is it turns out actually, fifteen

162
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:44,089
of them had a head tendency, fifteen had a
tail. And the average of the, of the heads

163
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:52,013
is 12.9 and average of our tail tendencies
is 8.3. Now, after I feed them the snack,

164
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:58,069
I can flip that again. And, I've
highlighted in yellow and bolded again,

165
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:04,013
that the numbers that have a head
tendency. And there's essentially no

166
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:10,090
correlation between here. It does turn out
that our heads, have our, our initial

167
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:17,001
heads have an average of 10.7 after eating
the bagel. And our initials tails have an

168
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:22,080
average of 9.6. So, we can see that both
of these regress towards the mean. Both of

169
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,043
these are closer towards the expected
value of ten and a half. We may see a

170
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:33,086
perceived difference here between the 9.6
and the 10.7. In a future lecture, we'll

171
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:38,054
learn how to test whether that's a real
difference or whether that's a statistical

172
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:44,014
mirage. So, this danger of regression is
very real and it shows up all the time in

173
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:48,066
statistical analyses of things like low
performing schools increasing in the next

174
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:53,029
year or high performing schools
decreasing. The assignment problem that

175
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:58,044
results in regression to the mean, is when
you're making something like a dividing

176
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:02,039
line and you're using the assignment so
everybody who scores high goes up and

177
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,065
everybody who scores low goes down and
then you measure their performance

178
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:11,031
subsequently. If instead you use the
pre-test to counterbalance, like we did

179
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:15,078
with the typists, so we put high and
low-speed typists in both conditions, then

180
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,061
you no longer have that worry about
regression to the mean. So, the major

181
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:26,071
question that we tackled here is, should
every participant use every alternative?

182
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:32,054
And with it emerged was three major
strategies. In a Within-subjects design,

183
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:37,039
everybody tries all the options. This has
big benefits in terms of recruiting

184
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,067
participants. You get more work out of
each person. And it works really well when

185
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:45,053
you're not worried about learning or
practice or exposure issues. Trying one

186
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:50,087
version will pollute the other one. In
Between-subjects study, each person tries

187
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:55,062
one condition. This requires more people
and you may want to consider

188
00:17:55,062 --> 00:18:00,044
counterbalancing for fair assignment. It
has the benefit of course, that each

189
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:05,067
participant is uncorrupted and for this
reason is the most common thing we see in

190
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:10,052
things like web studies. And if you use it
between subjects design, you can use

191
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:15,059
counterbalancing to help even things out.
What I am offering today, is just a really

192
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,046
high level overview. And I've necessarily
glossed over a whole bunch of important

193
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:24,071
details. But I wanted to give you a
initial lay of the land for running

194
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:30,027
studies. If you're interested in more,
more reading in this area, my favorite

195
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:37,040
book in this area is David Martin's book
Doing Psychology Experiments. I'll see you

196
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,006
next time.
