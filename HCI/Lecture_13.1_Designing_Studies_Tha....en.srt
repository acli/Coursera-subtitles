1
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:07,295
In this lecture, we’re going to talk about trying out new interface with people and doing this on the way 

2
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:12,050
that you can improve your designs based on what you learned.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,356
One of the most common things the people asks when running studies is, 

4
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:20,990
do you like my interface and it’s a really natural thing to ask but on some levels what we all want to know.

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,916
But this is really problematic on a whole lot of level.

6
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:28,822
For one it’s not very specific and so some people are trying to make this better 

7
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:34,359
and so they’ll improve it by doing something like how much do you like my interface on one to five scale.

8
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,637
Or this useful interface?

9
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:38,186
Agree or disagree on one to five scale.

10
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:41,498
And this adds some kind of a patina of scientific-ness to it 

11
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:45,595
but really it’s just the same thing you’re asking somebody do you like my interface?

12
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:50,464
And people are nice so they’re going to say sure I like your interface.

13
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,703
This, the please the experiment bias.

14
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,822
And this can be especially strong when our social or cultural 

15
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:02,621
or power differences between the experimenter and the people that you’re trying at your interface with.

16
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:05,061
For example, in [inaudible] effecting India 

17
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:09,316
where this effect was exacerbated when the experimenter was white.

18
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:15,908
Now, you should not take this to mean that you shouldn’t have your developers try out stuff with users.

19
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:21,800
Being the person who is both the developer and the person who is trying stuff out is incredible valuable.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,595
And one example like a lot of this is Mike Krieger, 

21
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:28,992
one of the Instagram founders is also former masters student in [inaudible].

22
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:31,610
And Mike when he left Stanford and join Silicon Valley, 

23
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,234
every Friday afternoon he would bring people into the lab into his office 

24
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:39,610
and have them try out whatever they were working on that week 

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,634
and so that way they were able to get this regular feedback each week.

26
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:48,428
And, the people who were building on the system got to see real people trying them out.

27
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:52,745
This can be nails on the chart board painful, but you’ll also learn a ton.

28
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,841
So, how do we get beyond, do you like my interface?

29
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:59,028
The basic strategy that we’re going to talk about today is being 

30
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:05,154
to use specific measures and concrete questions to be able to deliver meaningful results.

31
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:09,724
One of the problems of do you like my interface is compared to what.

32
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:15,151
And I think one of the reasons that people say yeah sure, is that there’s no comparison point.

33
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:21,839
And so, one thing is really important is when you’re measuring the effectiveness of your interface, 

34
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:26,016
even informally, it’s really nice, to have some kind of comparison.

35
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:28,718
It’s also important to think about what’s the yard stick?

36
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:30,987
What constitutes good in this arena?

37
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:33,925
What are the measures that you’re going to use?

38
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:37,360
So how can we get beyond do you like my interface?

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,154
One of the ways that we can start out is by asking a base rate question like, 

40
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:47,416
what fraction of people click on the first link in the search results page?

41
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,648
Or, what fraction of students come to class.

42
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,100
Once we start to measure correlation, 

43
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,950
things get even more interesting like is there a relationship between the time 

44
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,709
of day that classes offered and how many students attend it 

45
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,387
or is there a relationship between the order of a search result and a click through rate.

46
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:12,391
For both students and [inaudible], there can be multiple explanations.

47
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:17,697
For example, if there are fewer students that attend early morning classes, 

48
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,661
is that a function when students want to show up or 

49
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:23,993
is that a good function on when good professors want to teach?

50
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:29,250
With the [inaudible] example, there are also two kinds of explanations.

51
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,662
If lower placed links yield fewer clicks.

52
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:39,341
Is that because the links are intrinsically poor quality or is it because people just click on the first link.

53
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:44,924
They don’t, they don’t bother getting to second one even if it might be better.

54
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,999
To isolate the effect of placement and identifying and explaining the cause of roll, 

55
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:54,304
he needs to isolate that as a variable by saying randomizing the order of search results.

56
00:03:54,304 --> 00:04:01,133
As we start to talk about these experiments, let’s introduce a few terms that are going to help us.

57
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:06,270
The multiple different conditions that we try, That’s the thing that we’re manipulating.

58
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:12,610
For example the time of the class or the location of a particular link on a search results page.

59
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:19,059
These manipulations are independent variables because they’re independent of what the user does.

60
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,403
They are in the control of experimenter.

61
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:28,865
Then, we’re going to measure what the user does and those measures are called Dependent Variables 

62
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:31,866
because they depend on what the user does.

63
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:36,280
Common measures in HCI include things like to ask completion time.

64
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,045
How long does it take somebody to complete a task for example, 

65
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:44,859
find something you want to buy, create a new account, order an item, Accuracy.

66
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:48,900
How many mistakes that people make and one of those fatal errors or those things 

67
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,341
that they were able to quickly recover from?

68
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:55,357
We call how much the person remember afterward or after periods of nine years?

69
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:59,997
And emotional response, how does the person feel about the task being completed?

70
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:01,264
Were they confident?

71
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:02,368
Were they stressed?

72
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,760
Would the user recommend this system to a friend?

73
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,220
So, your independent variables are the things that you manipulate.

74
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,661
Your dependent variables are the things that you measure how reliable is your experiment.

75
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,214
If you ran this again, would you see the same result?

76
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:19,781
That’s the internal validity of the experiment.

77
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:22,079
So, have a precise experiment.

78
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,093
You need to be able to remove the confounding factors.

79
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:31,212
Also, it’s important to study enough people so that the results are unlikely to [inaudible] by chance.

80
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:35,279
You may be able to run this study, same study over and over and get the same result 

81
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:41,981
but it may not matter in some real word sense and the external validity is the generalize ability of result.

82
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:47,550
That this supply only the 18-year-old in the college classroom or this is supplied to everybody in the world.

83
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,159
Let’s bring this back to HCI and talk about one of the problems here like interface as a designer.

84
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,649
I think one of the things that we commonly want to be able to do 

85
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:01,772
is to be able to ask something like is my cool new approach better than the industry standard,.

86
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:05,007
Because after all that is why you’re making the new thing.

87
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:07,807
Now one of the challenges with this especially early 

88
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:13,242
on the design process is that you may have something which is very much in its prototype stages 

89
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,952
and something that is the industry standard is likely to benefit from years 

90
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:20,979
and years of refinement and at the same time it may be stuck with years 

91
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:25,449
and years of craft which may or may not be intrinsic to its approach.

92
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,539
So if you compare your cool new tool to Sun Industry standard, there’s two things varying here.

93
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:35,789
One is the fidelity of the implementation and the other one of course is the approach.

94
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:37,877
Consequently when you get the results, 

95
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:44,330
you can’t know whether to attribute the result to fidelity, or approach, or some combination of the two.

96
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,037
So, we’re going to talk about ways of teasing a part of those different [inaudible] factors.

97
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:52,826
Now, one thing I should say right off the bat is there sometimes 

98
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:58,056
where maybe less more relevant whether you have a good handling what the [inaudible] factors are.

99
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:04,622
So, for example, you’re trying to decide between two different digital cameras, at the end of the day, 

100
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:10,306
maybe all you care about is image quality or usability and some other factor and exactly what the Makes 

101
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:16,242
that image quality better or worse or any other element along the way maybe less relevant to you.

102
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:23,159
If you don’t have control over the variables, then identifying cause may not always be what you want,.

103
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:27,160
But when you’re a designer, you do have control over the variables and 

104
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,301
that’s when it’s really important to [inaudible] the cause.

105
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:36,768
Here’s the example of a study that came out right when iPhone was released 

106
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:42,440
done by research firm users center centric from this news article here Research firm use 

107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,501
as centric as release to study the trials to gauge how effective the iPhone’s unusual onscreen keyboard is.

108
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:55,054
The goal is certainly a noble, noble one but I cannot say the surveys approach results in data 

109
00:07:55,054 --> 00:08:00,551
that makes much sense Users centric broad in twenty owners of other phones.

110
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:05,409
Half had QWERTY keyboards, half had ordinary numeric phones with keypads.

111
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:08,145
None were familiar with the iPhone.

112
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:13,624
The research involved having the test subjects enter six sample test messages with the phones 

113
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:18,016
that they already had and six with iPhone.

114
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:21,688
The end result was that the iPhone movies took twice as long 

115
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:27,444
to enter text with an iPhone as they did with their own phones and made lots more typos.

116
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:31,386
So, let’s critique the study and talk about its benefits and drawbacks.

117
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:35,047
Here’s the web page directly from user centric.

118
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,261
What’s our manipulation study?

119
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:42,307
Well, the manipulation is going to be the input style.

120
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:49,006
And how about the measure in the study Is going to be the worst per minute.

121
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:56,528
And there’s absolutely value in being able to measure the initial usability of the iPhone For several reasons, 

122
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:59,589
one is if you’re introducing new technology, 

123
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,545
it’s beneficial and people are able to get up the speed pretty quickly.

124
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:09,610
However, it’s important to realize that this comparison is eccentrically unfair 

125
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,800
because the users of the, the previous cell phones were experts at that input modality.

126
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,712
And if people who are using the iPhone or not [inaudible] modality.

127
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:23,976
And so, it seems quite likely that the iPhone users, once they become actually users, 

128
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:29,810
are going to get better over time and so, if you’re not used to something the first time you try it, 

129
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,390
that may not be a deal killer and it’s certainly not an Apple to Apple’s comparison.

130
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,820
Another thing that we don’t get out of this article is, 

131
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,609
is this different significant so we read that each person typed six messages 

132
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:53,196
in each of two conditions and so they did their own device in the iPhone 

133
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:59,561
or vice versa six messages each and that the iPhone users were half the speed 

134
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:05,279
or the mini rather than people typing with the iPhone were half 

135
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,274
as fast as when they got to type with the mini qwerty, device they were accustomed to.

136
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:17,155
So this may tell us something about the initial usability of the iPhone.

137
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:23,513
In terms of the long use ability, long term usability you know I don’t think we get so much out this here.

138
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:27,553
If you are not satisfied by the initial data, you’re in good company.

139
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,373
Neither or the office to that study.

140
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:33,887
So, they want back a month later and they ran another study where they brought 

141
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:39,648
in 40 new people t o the lab who were either iPhone users, QWERTY users or nine-key users.

142
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:45,360
And now, it’s more of an Apple to Apple’s comparison and not they’re going to test people 

143
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,144
who are relatively experts in this three different modalities.

144
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:51,441
After about a month On the iPhone, 

145
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:55,318
you’re probably starting to ask and thought in terms of your performance.

146
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:58,858
Definitely it gets better over time even past the month.

147
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:03,132
But you know a month starts to get more reasonable.

148
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:11,071
And what they found was that iPhone users and QWERTY users were about the same.

149
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:15,626
In terms of speed and, and that the numeric keypad users were much lower.

150
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:22,050
So, one again, our manipulation is going to be input style and we’re going to measure speed.

151
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,285
This time, we’re also going to measure error rate and what we see 

152
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:32,294
is that iPhone users and QWERTY users are essentially the same speed.

153
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:36,794
However, The iPhone users make many more errors.

154
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:40,680
Now one thing I should point out of the study is 

155
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,791
that each of the Different devices was used by different group of people.

156
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,794
And it was done this way so that each.

157
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:55,628
Each device was used by somebody who is comfortable and have experience with working with 

158
00:11:55,628 --> 00:12:01,197
that device and so we remove the worry that you have newbie’s working on these devices.

159
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:05,680
However, specially in 2007, there may have been significant differences 

160
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,588
in who the people were who were using the early adaptors of the 2007 iPhone 

161
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:16,960
or maybe business users were particularly drawn to the Qwerty devices or people who had better things 

162
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,318
to do with their time than sending e-mail on the telephone or using the nine-key devices and so.

163
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:26,581
Well, this comparison is better than the previous one.

164
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:32,323
The potential for variation between the user populations is still problematic if what you would like 

165
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:36,000
to be able to claim is something about the intrinsic properties 

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,214
of the device and they, and this impart have to do with the users.

167
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:44,399
So what are some strategies for pair comparison?

168
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,574
To brain storm a couple of options, one thing 

169
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:53,247
that you can do is insert your approach into a production setting and this may seem like a lot of work.

170
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:57,425
Sometimes it is but in the age of the web this is a lot easier than it used 

171
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,638
to be and it’s possible even if you don’t have access 

172
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:03,446
to the server of the service that you’re comparing against.

173
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:07,128
You can use things like a proxy server or client touch scripting 

174
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:11,913
to be able to put your own technique and have an Apple to Apple comparison.

175
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:18,234
The second strategy for neutralizing environment difference between a production version 

176
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:26,065
and your new approach is to make a version of the production thing in the same style as your new approach.

177
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:30,883
That also makes them equivalent in terms of their implementation fidelity.

178
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:33,871
A third strategy in one that’s use economy in research 

179
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:39,124
is to scale things down so you’re looking at just a piece of system in a particular point in time.

180
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:43,340
That way you don’t have you worry about implementing a whole big giant thing, 

181
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,087
you can just focus on one small piece and have that comparison be fair.

182
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:54,041
And the fourth strategy is that when expertise is relevant, train people up, 

183
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:58,808
give them the practice that they need so that they can start at least hitting 

184
00:13:58,808 --> 00:14:05,267
that [inaudible] in terms of performance and you can get a better read than what it would be as newbie’s.

185
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:09,591
So, now to close out this lecture, if somebody asked you the question, 

186
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:12,855
who’s interface acts better than the interface and why, 

187
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:16,666
you know, you have a good start because we have a comparison.

188
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,655
However, you also know to be worried, what is better mean?

189
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:23,899
And often, in a complex system, you’re going to have several measures, 

190
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:28,711
that’s totally cool, there’s a lot of value in being explicit though about what it 

191
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:33,558
is that you mean by better, what are you trying to accomplish, what are you trying to improve?

192
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:38,184
And if anybody ever tells you that their interface is always better, 

193
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:43,788
don’t believe them because nearly all the time the answer is going to be it depends.

194
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:48,650
And the interesting question is what does it depend on.

195
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,727
Most interfaces are good for some things and not for others.

196
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:58,391
For example, if you have a, a tablet computer where all of the screen is devoted to display, 

197
00:14:58,391 --> 00:15:04,062
that’s going to be great for reading, for web browsing for that kind of activity looking at pictures.

198
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:06,834
Not so good if you want to type a noble.

199
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,708
So here, we’re introduced control comparison 

200
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,860
as a way of finding he smoking gun and as a way of inferring cause.

201
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,345
And often for when you have only two conditions, 

202
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:21,222
we’re going to talk about that as being a minimal pair of design.

203
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:25,345
As a practicing designer, the reason to care about what’s [inaudible] 

204
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:30,148
is that it gives you the material to make a better decision going forward.

205
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:34,022
A lot of studies violate this constraint and that gets dangerous 

206
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:38,832
because it doesn’t, it, it prevents you from being able to make sound decisions.

207
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:42,174
I hope that the tools that we talked about today and 

208
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:48,727
in the next several lectures we’ll help you become a wise and skeptic like our friend in this XKCD Comic.

209
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,096
I’ll see you next time.
