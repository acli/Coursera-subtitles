1
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:06,059
In this lecture, we're going to talk about
trying out new interface with people and

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:11,022
doing this on the way that you can improve
your designs based on what you learned.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,066
One of the most common things the people
asks when running studies is, do you like

4
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:20,066
my interface and it's a really natural
thing to ask but on some levels what we

5
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:24,070
all want to know. But this is really
problematic on a whole lot of level. For

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,020
one it's not very specific and so some
people are trying to make this better and

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,081
so they'll improve it by doing something
like how much do you like my interface on

8
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:37,082
one to five scale Or this useful
interface? Agree or disagree on one to

9
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:42,053
five scale And this adds some kind of a
patina of scientific-ness to it but really

10
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:46,089
it's just the same thing you're asking
somebody do you like my interface? And

11
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:51,003
people are nice so they're going to say
sure I like your interface. This, the

12
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:55,084
please the experiment bias And this can be
especially strong when our social or

13
00:00:55,084 --> 00:01:01,001
cultural or power differences between the
experimenter and the people that you're

14
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:05,061
trying at your interface with. For
example, in [inaudible] effecting India

15
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:10,067
where this effect was exacerbated when the
experimenter was white. Now, you should

16
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:15,048
not take this to mean that you shouldn't
have your developers try out stuff with

17
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:20,012
users. Being the person who is both the
developer and the person who is trying

18
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:24,049
stuff out is incredible valuable. And one
example like a lot of this is Mike

19
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,068
Krieger, one of the Instagram founders is
also former masters student in

20
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:32,076
[inaudible]. And Mike when he left
Stanford and join Silicon Valley, every

21
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:37,034
Friday afternoon he would bring people
into the lab into his office and have them

22
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:42,014
try out whatever they were working on that
week and so that way they were able to get

23
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:46,078
this regular feedback each week. And, the
people who were building on the system got

24
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,025
to see real people trying them out. This
can be nails on the chart board painful,

25
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:56,019
but you'll also learn a ton. So, how do we
get beyond, do you like my interface? The

26
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:00,090
basic strategy that we're going to talk
about today is being to use specific

27
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,024
measures and concrete questions to be able
to deliver meaningful results. One of the

28
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:11,034
problems of do you like my interface is
compared to what. And I think one of the

29
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:16,049
reasons that people say yeah sure, is that
there's no comparison point. And so, one

30
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:21,039
thing is really important is when you're
measuring the effectiveness of your

31
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,016
interface, even informally, it's really
nice, to have some kind of comparison.

32
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:30,083
It's also important to think about what's
the yard stick? What constitutes good in

33
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:35,072
this arena? What are the measures that
you're going to use? So how can we get

34
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:40,070
beyond do you like my interface? One of
the ways that we can start out is by

35
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:46,002
asking a base rate question like, what
fraction of people click on the first link

36
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:51,065
in the search results page? Or, what
fraction of students come to class. Once

37
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:56,078
we start to measure correlation, things
get even more interesting like is there a

38
00:02:56,078 --> 00:03:01,085
relationship between the time of day that
classes offered and how many students

39
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:06,091
attend it or is there a relationship
between the order of a search result and a

40
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:11,077
click through rate. For both students and
[inaudible], there can be multiple

41
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:17,013
explanations. For example, if there are
fewer students that attend early morning

42
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:22,049
classes, is that a function when students
want to show up or is that a good function

43
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,039
on when good professors want to teach?
With the [inaudible] example, there are

44
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,085
also two kinds of explanations. If lower
placed links yield fewer clicks. Is that

45
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:38,069
because the links are intrinsically poor
quality or is it because people just click

46
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:44,024
on the first link. They don't, they don't
bother getting to second one even if it

47
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:48,075
might be better. To isolate the effect of
placement and identifying and explaining

48
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:52,081
the cause of roll, he needs to isolate
that as a variable by saying randomizing

49
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:58,013
the order of search results. As we start
to talk about these experiments, let's

50
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:03,086
introduce a few terms that are going to
help us. The multiple different conditions

51
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:08,078
that we try, That's the thing that we're
manipulating. For example the time of the

52
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:13,028
class or the location of a particular link
on a search results page. These

53
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:18,014
manipulations are independent variables
because they're independent of what the

54
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:24,077
user does. They are in the control of
experimenter. Then, we're going to measure

55
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:30,016
what the user does and those measures are
called Dependent Variables because they

56
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:35,034
depend on what the user does. Common
measures in HCI include things like to ask

57
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:40,045
completion time. How long does it take
somebody to complete a task for example,

58
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:45,036
find something you want to buy, create a
new account, order an item, Accuracy. How

59
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:49,079
many mistakes that people make and one of
those fatal errors or those things that

60
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,089
they were able to quickly recover from? We
call how much the person remember

61
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:58,006
afterward or after periods of nine years?
And emotional response, how does the

62
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:02,000
person feel about the task being
completed? Were they confident? Were they

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,068
stressed? Would the user recommend this
system to a friend? So, your independent

64
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:11,013
variables are the things that you
manipulate. Your dependent variables are

65
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:16,006
the things that you measure how reliable
is your experiment. If you ran this again,

66
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:20,087
would you see the same result? That's the
internal validity of the experiment. So,

67
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:25,068
have a precise experiment. You need to be
able to remove the confounding factors.

68
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:30,006
Also, it's important to study enough
people so that the results are unlikely to

69
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:34,054
[inaudible] by chance. You may be able to
run this study, same study over and over

70
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:38,094
and get the same result but it may not
matter in some real word sense and the

71
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:43,012
external validity is the generalize
ability of result. That this supply only

72
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:47,070
the 18-year-old in the college classroom
or this is supplied to everybody in the

73
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,080
world. Let's bring this back to HCI and
talk about one of the problems here like

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,001
interface as a designer. I think one of
the things that we commonly want to be

75
00:05:56,001 --> 00:06:00,062
able to do is to be able to ask something
like is my cool new approach better than

76
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:05,007
the industry standard, Because after all
that is why you're making the new thing.

77
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:09,040
Now one of the challenges with this
especially early on the design process is

78
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,018
that you may have something which is very
much in its prototype stages and something

79
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:18,095
that is the industry standard is likely to
benefit from years and years of refinement

80
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:23,062
and at the same time it may be stuck with
years and years of craft which may or may

81
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:28,075
not be intrinsic to its approach. So if
you compare your cool new tool to Sun

82
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:32,089
Industry standard, there's two things
varying here. One is the fidelity of the

83
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:37,089
implementation and the other one of course
is the approach. Consequently when you get

84
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:42,020
the results, you can't know whether to
attribute the result to fidelity, or

85
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,049
approach, or some combination of the two.
So, we're going to talk about ways of

86
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:50,054
teasing a part of those different
[inaudible] factors. Now, one thing I

87
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:55,011
should say right off the bat is there
sometimes where maybe less more relevant

88
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:59,079
whether you have a good handling what the
[inaudible] factors are. So, for example,

89
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:04,018
you're trying to decide between two
different digital cameras, at the end of

90
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:09,010
the day, maybe all you care about is image
quality or usability and some other factor

91
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,069
and exactly what the Makes that image
quality better or worse or any other

92
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:18,095
element along the way maybe less relevant
to you. If you don't have control over the

93
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:24,015
variables, then identifying cause may not
always be what you want, But when you're a

94
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:28,090
designer, you do have control over the
variables and that's when it's really

95
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:35,008
important to [inaudible] the cause. Here's
the example of a study that came out right

96
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:40,080
when iPhone was released done by research
firm users center centric from this news

97
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,001
article here Research firm use as centric
as release to study the trials to gauge

98
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:50,033
how effective the iPhone's unusual
onscreen keyboard is. The goal is

99
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:55,054
certainly a noble, noble one but I cannot
say the surveys approach results in data

100
00:07:55,054 --> 00:08:01,030
that makes much sense Users centric broad
in twenty owners of other phones. Half had

101
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,045
QWERTY keyboards, half had ordinary
numeric phones with keypads. None were

102
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:11,094
familiar with the iPhone. The research
involved having the test subjects enter

103
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:17,080
six sample test messages with the phones
that they already had and six with iPhone.

104
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:23,000
The end result was that the iPhone movies
took twice as long to enter text with an

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,061
iPhone as they did with their own phones
and made lots more typos. So, let's

106
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:32,095
critique the study and talk about its
benefits and drawbacks. Here's the web

107
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:38,003
page directly from user centric. What's
our manipulation study? Well, the

108
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:45,016
manipulation is going to be the input
style And how about the measure in the

109
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:53,003
study Is going to be the worst per minute
And there's absolutely value in being able

110
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:57,092
to measure the initial usability of the
iPhone For several reasons, one is if

111
00:08:57,092 --> 00:09:03,001
you're introducing new technology, it's
beneficial and people are able to get up

112
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:08,026
the speed pretty quickly. However, it's
important to realize that this comparison

113
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:13,000
is eccentrically unfair because the users
of the, the previous cell phones were

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,062
experts at that input modality And if
people who are using the iPhone or not

115
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:22,029
[inaudible] modality And so, it seems
quite likely that the iPhone users, once

116
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:27,010
they become actually users, are going to
get better over time and so, if you're not

117
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,014
used to something the first time you try
it, that may not be a deal killer and it's

118
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:37,093
certainly not an Apple to Apple's
comparison. Another thing that we don't

119
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:44,073
get out of this article is, is this
different significant so we read that each

120
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:51,052
person typed six messages in each of two
conditions and so they did their own

121
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:58,041
device in the iPhone or vice versa six
messages each and that the iPhone users

122
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:05,041
were half the speed or the mini rather
than people typing with the iPhone were

123
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:11,000
half as fast as when they got to type with
the mini qwerty, device they were

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,099
accustomed to. So this may tell us
something about the initial usability of

125
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:21,030
the iPhone. In terms of the long use
ability, long term usability you know I

126
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,013
don't think we get so much out this here.
If you are not satisfied by the initial

127
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:30,087
data, you're in good company. Neither or
the office to that study. So, they want

128
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:35,092
back a month later and they ran another
study where they brought in 40 new people

129
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:40,079
t o the lab who were either iPhone users,
QWERTY users or nine-key users. And now,

130
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,016
it's more of an Apple to Apple's
comparison and not they're going to test

131
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:50,027
people who are relatively experts in this
three different modalities. After about a

132
00:10:50,027 --> 00:10:54,079
month On the iPhone, you're probably
starting to ask and thought in terms of

133
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,037
your performance. Definitely it gets
better over time even past the month. But

134
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:05,046
you know a month starts to get more
reasonable And what they found was that

135
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:13,018
iPhone users and QWERTY users were about
the same. In terms of speed and, and that

136
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:18,098
the numeric keypad users were much lower.
So, one again, our manipulation is going

137
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:24,041
to be input style and we're going to
measure speed. This time, we're also going

138
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:30,044
to measure error rate and what we see is
that iPhone users and QWERTY users are

139
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:37,044
essentially the same speed. However, The
iPhone users make many more errors. Now

140
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:44,019
one thing I should point out of the study
is that each of the Different devices was

141
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:50,038
used by different group of people. And it
was done this way so that each. Each

142
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:55,001
device was used by somebody who is
comfortable and have experience with

143
00:11:55,001 --> 00:12:00,029
working with that device and so we remove
the worry that you have newbie's working

144
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:05,012
on these devices. However, specially in
2007, there may have been significant

145
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:10,033
differences in who the people were who
were using the early adaptors of the 2007

146
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:15,048
iPhone or maybe business users were
particularly drawn to the Qwerty devices

147
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:20,069
or people who had better things to do with
their time than sending e-mail on the

148
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:25,053
telephone or using the nine-key devices
and so. Well, this comparison is better

149
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:30,035
than the previous one. The potential for
variation between the user populations is

150
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:35,028
still problematic if what you would like
to be able to claim is something about the

151
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:39,098
intrinsic properties of the device and
they, and this impart have to do with the

152
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:46,076
users. So what are some strategies for
pair comparison? To brain storm a couple

153
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:51,012
of options, one thing that you can do is
insert your approach into a production

154
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:55,049
setting and this may seem like a lot of
work. Sometimes it is but in the age of

155
00:12:55,049 --> 00:13:00,014
the web this is a lot easier than it used
to be and it's possible even if you don't

156
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:04,073
have access to the server of the service
that you're comparing against. You can use

157
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:09,015
things like a proxy server or client touch
scripting to be able to put your own

158
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:13,054
technique and have an Apple to Apple
comparison. The second strategy for

159
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:19,020
neutralizing environment difference
between a production version and your new

160
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:25,000
approach is to make a version of the
production thing in the same style as your

161
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,057
new approach. That also makes them
equivalent in terms of their

162
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:34,038
implementation fidelity. A third strategy
in one that's use economy in research is

163
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:38,068
to scale things down so you're looking at
just a piece of system in a particular

164
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:43,020
point in time. That way you don't have you
worry about implementing a whole big giant

165
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,028
thing, you can just focus on one small
piece and have that comparison be fair.

166
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:54,041
And the fourth strategy is that when
expertise is relevant, train people up,

167
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:59,043
give them the practice that they need so
that they can start at least hitting that

168
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:04,021
[inaudible] in terms of performance and
you can get a better read than what it

169
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:09,015
would be as newbie's. So, now to close out
this lecture, if somebody asked you the

170
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:14,010
question, who's interface acts better than
the interface and why, you know, you have

171
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,011
a good start because we have a comparison.
However, you also know to be worried, what

172
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:23,039
is better mean? And often, in a complex
system, you're going to have several

173
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,003
measures, that's totally cool, there's a
lot of value in being explicit though

174
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:32,086
about what it is that you mean by better,
what are you trying to accomplish, what

175
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:37,074
are you trying to improve? And if anybody
ever tells you that their interface is

176
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:42,072
always better, don't believe them because
nearly all the time the answer is going to

177
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:50,081
be it depends And the interesting question
is what does it depend on. Most interfaces

178
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:55,011
are good for some things and not for
others. For example, if you have a, a

179
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:59,077
tablet computer where all of the screen is
devoted to display, that's going to be

180
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:04,062
great for reading, for web browsing for
that kind of activity looking at pictures.

181
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:09,016
Not so good if you want to type a noble.
So here, we're introduced control

182
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:14,041
comparison as a way of finding he smoking
gun and as a way of inferring cause. And

183
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:19,002
often for when you have only two
conditions, we're going to talk about that

184
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:24,001
as being a minimal pair of design. As a
practicing designer, the reason to care

185
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:29,013
about what's [inaudible] is that it gives
you the material to make a better decision

186
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:34,022
going forward. A lot of studies violate
this constraint and that gets dangerous

187
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:39,039
because it doesn't, it, it prevents you
from being able to make sound decisions. I

188
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,056
hope that the tools that we talked about
today and in the next several lectures

189
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:49,079
we'll help you become a wise and skeptic
like our friend in this XKCD Comic. I'll

190
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,096
see you next time.
