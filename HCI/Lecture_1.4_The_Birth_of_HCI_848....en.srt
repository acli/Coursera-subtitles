1
00:00:01,054 --> 00:00:04,062
How did the field of human-computer interaction get started?

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:10,046
One good place to begin our story is in July of 1945, when Vannevar Bush wrote

3
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:16,050
an article for the Atlantic Monthly, later reprinted in Life, called “As We May Think”.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,001
Today, technology has mostly augmented people’s physical abilities;

5
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:29,019
Bush outlined a vision for information technologies that augmented people’s intellectual abilities.

6
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:33,002
Who is this guy? What’s his deal? And what led to his press in his vision?

7
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:36,099
Bush was vice-president and dean of engineering at MIT in the 1930’s,

8
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:39,072
where, incidentally, he was Fred Terman’s advisor.

9
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,065
Terman went on to become dean of engineering at Stanford

10
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:45,072
and in the eyes of many the father of Silicon Valley.

11
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:48,086
In 1939, Vannevar Bush moved to Washington.

12
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:51,072
He’s a leading scientific policy maker

13
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:53,082
He directs a lot of the government funding,

14
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:58,074
and indeed creates and is instrumental in setting up large-scale university research.

15
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:03,052
This administrative effort eventually leads to the creation of the National Science Foundation and ARPA,

16
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:07,009
institutionalizing government-funded scientific research.

17
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:10,078
The goal of this article, written in the final months of World War II, is to ask

18
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:15,091
“What can government-funded scientists do to create a better world in peace time?”

19
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:19,007
and his vision was a strongly human-centred one.

20
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:23,045
Bush wrote of a future interactive desk; he calls the system Memex.

21
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:28,051
The idea is that all of the world’s information would be available on the knowledge worker’s desktop.

22
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:34,094
Key to the Memex idea was effective user interfaces for information storage and retrieval.

23
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:39,041
Remember, this is 1945, so there aren’t yet practical digital computers —

24
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:44,094
the first room-scale digital computers were just being built, and the idea was to use microfiche —

25
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:47,089
high density film — to store everything!

26
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:51,097
Even more impressive, Bush’s Memex vision invents hypertext:

27
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:56,068
he has this idea that people could author trails through this information store,

28
00:01:56,068 --> 00:02:00,014
save them for later use, and share them with others.

29
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:04,028
But you’re not always at your desk, right? You want technology to come with you.

30
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:07,098
And knowledge workers need to produce content as well as consume it.

31
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:11,041
And the world isn’t just textual; it’s also visual.

32
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,056
So Bush imagined that, in the future, you’d wear a camera,

33
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:19,025
right in the centre of your head, like a third eye, and use it to capture stuff.

34
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:23,004
And he worked out a design that made it as easy as possible to take pictures,

35
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:26,009
so there’re no dials or settings to fiddle with.

36
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:32,041
As with the Memex desk, the details turned out differently; but the core vision was right on target.

37
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:36,053
Today, for example, there are more than a billion camera phones that people carry with them.

38
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:41,092
The programmable digital computers that soon follow, like the ENIACS on here,

39
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:44,034
were a huge technological lead-forward.

40
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:48,058
But, as you can see from the wires, the user interface left a lot to be desired.

41
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:53,057
The idea of providing a more effective interface to computers has a long and storied history,

42
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:58,062
beginning with Grace Hopper’s invention in the early 1950’s of the first compiler.

43
00:02:58,062 --> 00:03:01,072
What’s inspirational for me is that she conceptualized

44
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:06,071
how improved tools could provide a much wider audience with access  to computation.

45
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:10,026
In the intervening years, good programming environments for the desktop and Web

46
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:14,098
enabled legions of developers to create the content that helped put a PC on every desk.

47
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:20,053
It’s a long path from the Grace Hopper’s visionary work on the compiler to the graphical user interface.

48
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:23,099
There are three key highlights I’d like to share with you along the way.

49
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:29,094
The seeds of direct manipulation were sown at MIT at Lincoln Labs by Ivan Sutherland.

50
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:33,058
The key innovation of the graphical user interface is that the user’s input

51
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:36,064
is performed directly on top of the system’s output.

52
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:43,032
This input-on-output directness makes the interface much easier to understand and much more intuitive.

53
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:49,038
This input-on-output directness makes the system much easier to understand and feel more intuitive.

54
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:55,042
In the case of Sutherland’s Sketchpad, the input was a light pen and the output was an oscilloscope.

55
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:58,084
Here’s a short clip of the system in action:

56
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:01,097
(You can see, we have several unusal pieces of input-output equipment here.

57
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:06,042
We have a scope, and these are unusual at the time.

58
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:10,021
And pushbuttons. Toggle switches.

59
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:12,012
We have several other related devices.

60
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:17,039
This made the TX-2 a fine candidate for the Sketchpad devlepments back in 1961.

61
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:23,051
As I draw my art of say… on the scope, it reinforces what I have in mind.

62
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,051
This is in general part of the design process.)

63
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:30,051
The next major stop on our journey is the creation of the mouse and hypertext;

64
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,078
these are key foundations for the Web.

65
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:36,048
In 1945, Doug Engelbart was a navy radar technician.

66
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:39,025
Engelbart spent his monotonous years in the Philippines.

67
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:45,071
In the library, he found a copy of the magazine Life; It reprinted Bush’s Atlantic Monthly article.

68
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:51,028
As John Markov writes, the idea of a device that could extend the power of the human mind

69
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:54,025
left Engelbart awestruck.

70
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:58,088
He had a vision. It took a long time, but eventually he got some funding and set to work.

71
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:04,024
And what Doug Engelbart came up with, he showed to the world in his famous 1968 demo.

72
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:11,005
(The research program that I’m going to describe to you is quickly characterizable by saying,

73
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:18,001
if, in your office, you, as an intellectual worker, were supplied with a computer display,

74
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:22,050
backed up by a computer that was alive for you all day,

75
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,055
and was infinitely responsive to the reaction you have,

76
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,072
how much value will you derive from that?

77
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:30,082
And in a second you’ll see the screen and it’s working.

78
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:36,028
And the way the tracking spot moves in conjunction with movements of that mouse.)

79
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:40,061
Engelbart’s mouse worked with two orthogonal wheels.

80
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:47,037
Each was a potentiometer, a variable resistor, like  stereos commonly have for a volume knob.

81
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:50,055
So you get about 300° of a turn and that’s it.

82
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:55,011
Its usable parameter provided about 5 inches of motion in each direction.

83
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:58,038
After the 1968 demo, Doug takes a show on the road.

84
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:02,058
He travels the country with a 16-millimetre Bell & Howell projector.

85
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:06,071
Ivan Sutherland had recently joined the faculty at the University  of Utah.

86
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:14,014
Doug comes to visit and shows the demo, and in the audience is Ivan’s PhD student Alan Kay.

87
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:16,017
Alan has been dreaming of a personal computer.

88
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:21,005
He sees Engelbart’s video and his eyes bugged out — they have the same dream.

89
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,010
After his PhD, Alan moved to the Stanford AI Lab,

90
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,034
where John McCarthy’s group has an early time-sharing system,

91
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:31,061
maybe the place in the world where every person had their own terminal.

92
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:35,098
From there, he moves to Xerox PARC, where he fleshes out his vision of a Dynabook.

93
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:40,077
Here is a picture of the prototype that Alan made in the early 1970’s.

94
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:42,076
This isn’t a functioning computer at all;

95
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:46,079
it’s made out of carboard; it’s a prototype designed to communicate a vision.

96
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,088
With this vision in hand, Alan Kay and his colleagues at Xerox PARC start building

97
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:54,040
the foundation of the first real graphical user interface.

98
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,097
It took them a decade to get it all together, to get it ready to ship.

99
00:06:57,097 --> 00:07:01,052
Xerox released the STAR computing system in 1981.

100
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:07,000
The STAR featured a bitmapped display, a window-based graphical user interface, icons, folders,

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,035
mice, ethernet network, file servers, print servers, and email.

102
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:14,082
This next clip shows the fruit of their labour:

103
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:20,018
(The display screen shows your working environment; we call this the desktop.

104
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:24,096
Using the Move key, you can arrange your desktop in any way you like.

105
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:29,095
Making a copy of one of these blank documents is like turning a sheet off a pad of paper.

106
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:33,025
The [inaudible] of users to make their own form pads

107
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:36,066
is one example of the usatibility [sic] built into the system.

108
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:39,084
The screen closely approximates the appearance of a printed page.

109
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:46,054
And I’m going to copy it into this upper document, and the new paragraph will appear here.

110
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:52,031
This is a little window that lets me set the various parameters of the paragraph.)

111
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:57,074
When the STAR shipped, this was almost four decades after Vannevar Bush’s vision,

112
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:03,051
three decades after Grace Hopper’s compiler, two decades after Doug Engelbart’s first functioning system,

113
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:09,080
and a decade after Alan Kay set off to work building this computer, inspired by the Dynabook ideas.

114
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,062
This is an example of what Bill Buxton calls “the ‘Long Nose’ of Innovation”,

115
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:17,007
that the early ideas behind a new technology paradigm

116
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:22,087
are often seeded decades before the major commercial adoption.

117
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:26,028
I’m sharing this history as we begin this course for a couple  of reasons:

118
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:31,054
First, seeing seminal work reminds me that good ideas are often klunkier early on.

119
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:36,001
Second, as Johnny Lee and Bill Buxton point out, if you are looking for a good future product,

120
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:42,052
the seeds you need may already be out there in rough form, waiting for you to polish it and do a diamond.

121
00:08:42,052 --> 99:59:59,000
Third, I just think these early systems are totally awesome and it’s really inspiring.
