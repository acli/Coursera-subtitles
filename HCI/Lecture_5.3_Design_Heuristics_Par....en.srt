1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:05,057
Let's continue our journey of these design
heuristics. Before we do, I'd like to

2
00:00:05,057 --> 00:00:10,013
remind you that many of the interfaces
that we're gonna look at could fit into

3
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:14,039
multiple different multiple heuristics,
and the most important thing is to

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,018
identify the problem. If you identify and
fix the problem, the label is of secondary

5
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:26,061
importance. Our next heuristic is
recognition over recall. Create interfaces

6
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:32,030
that make objects, actions, options, and
directions visible or easily retrievable

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:38,007
And one of my favorite examples of this is
any time you see a post it note, that

8
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:43,040
probably means that the relevant
information isn't as ready at hand as it

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,045
ought to be. Here's a photograph I took of
one of our lunch meetings. And here you

10
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:55,044
can see we have shwarma and felafel. They
each have a number on them And we have a

11
00:00:55,044 --> 00:01:01,099
code that's used to distinguish which
number means which kind of sandwich And of

12
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:06,013
course, the reason for this is that
someone spent all their time making these

13
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:10,032
delicious, and didn't take the time to
write out the whole label on it. So it's

14
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:14,062
understandable and fixable But, from an
interface design perspective, it would be

15
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:19,002
faster to find the chicken shawarma if it
was direc-, written directly on there, as

16
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:26,014
opposed to in code. [sound]. [sound]
Here's a screen shot of a ticket-buying

17
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:31,006
website, and what you can see is that it
gives you a couple of options like buy

18
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:35,067
tickets for today or for a future day.
There's a couple of problems from a

19
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:40,066
heuristics perspective with this screen
For starters, and we'll get to this in a

20
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:45,075
little bit, the layout is kind of all over
the place But also the thing that we're

21
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:50,066
going to look at here is the fact that we
have this intermediate screen which I

22
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:55,052
think could be done away with, with clever
design. It, for example, brings you to a

23
00:01:55,052 --> 00:02:00,049
page that offers up show times for today
and offers you a dialogue box to switch

24
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,051
the day. By setting up reasonable defaults
you can avoid extra hurdles In addition to

25
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:11,065
leading with reasonable defaults; it can
be valuable to provide previews. This is a

26
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:16,028
screen shot of a web design too l where
there are many templates available.

27
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:21,055
However, all of the templates are shown in
textural listing, which is not well suited

28
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:26,062
for the task. You have to think through
whether that's what you want, and that's a

29
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:32,007
difficult thing to do reliably By contrast
this is a different web design tool that

30
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:37,021
offers previews of all of the templates
available, and it's much simpler to see if

31
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:44,040
that's the design that you'd like. Next
up, flexibility and efficiency And simple

32
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,099
and straight forward example of this is to
provide keyboard accelerator shortcuts and

33
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:55,016
similar things like that for experts. This
is the view menu of the Firefox web

34
00:02:55,016 --> 00:03:00,028
browser And this is a great example of
offering flexibility and support for

35
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:04,099
experts in two ways. First, we can see
that there are keyboard shortcuts

36
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:10,058
available And second, the view source menu
will let you retrieve the page source of

37
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:15,063
any page you're looking at. So you can
look under the hood, not something that

38
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:20,091
most people want to do, valuable for
experts. This is the Expedia hotel search,

39
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:25,077
and it does a really nice job of making
the common cases quite easy to get to.

40
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:30,069
Popular cities are shown with a radio
button But also, if you'd like to go to a

41
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:35,067
less popular city, there's a free entry
field that you can type in anything that

42
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:40,090
you want. And so this is a nice example of
defaults with options. Flexible interfaces

43
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,007
can also foreground and push rather than
ambient information. This is a screen shot

44
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:51,018
of busy cow, which will allow you to view
the weather forecast on your weekly view

45
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:57,009
of your calendar. Here's another example
of productivity in the user interface.

46
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,096
This is Google's email. Which, if you
click spam on a recipient that it knows

47
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:07,022
how to unsubscribe you from, it will offer
the opportunity to directly unsubscribe

48
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:12,078
you from that email as well And I think
this is an example of how, if you're going

49
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:17,087
to be proactive in an interface, you need
to do it well And offer a clear,

50
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:23,052
immediate, task-relevant benefit. People
generally don't like proactive interfaces

51
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:28,043
that distract, break flow, or provide
irrelevant info rmation. Another nice

52
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:33,053
example of support for richer use is to
offer recommendations on a particular page

53
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:38,062
And so here you can see if you like this
one beverage here are other beverages you

54
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:46,019
might like [sound] and again, if you're
gonna offer recommendations, or other

55
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,075
kinds of pro activity, keep it relevant.
This is an example from Amazon of

56
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:55,075
discussion for a, for products that are
almost entirely unrelated to the product

57
00:04:55,075 --> 00:05:01,012
that is being shown And it just distracts
from the user's main goal. Mostly they're

58
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:06,012
wondering why on Earth did these things
end up at the bottom of some completely

59
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:12,008
unrelated webpage And finally, flexibility
can be incredibly valuable. It is possible

60
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:18,030
to go overboard. This is a photograph from
Bill Moggridge who shows an interview with

61
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,087
a user who had hacked their remote control
to limit it to just the relevant

62
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:29,050
functionality that they needed. And so,
flexibility can sometimes be a tension

63
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:37,094
with minimalism. Our eighth heuristic is
aesthetic and minimalist design. When

64
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:43,045
people view your webpage for example,
they're viewing it on a screen, and so

65
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:48,055
they see not the entire page But one
screen's worth at a given time. What they

66
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:53,032
see is what's called above the fold. It
comes from newspapers. Here's an example

67
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:57,067
of a screen where the relevant
information, what the weather forecast is,

68
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:02,050
is not even visible anywhere above the
fold. Everything above the fold is all of

69
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,034
the chrome and extra stuff But the core
information you have to scroll down for

70
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:12,023
And to the extent that you're trying to
optimize for user experience, it would be

71
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:21,012
better to have the core information above
the fold. As we'll talk about in visual

72
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:26,022
design, if you're gonna use color and
other cues, have them mean something, and

73
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:31,032
do so judiciously. Here's an example of a
check out page that's using lots of

74
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:36,094
different colors, and has a real cacophony
in terms of its hierarchical organization

75
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:43,040
on screen, for no apparent purpose And
here's a screen shot from Goggle's help

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,030
system. Google is often thought of as an
example of minimalist design and they

77
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,020
often do this quit e well. I wanted to
show one example where, I think, some more

78
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,010
information could be stripped out, or
rather some more noise could be stripped

79
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,041
out And what I'm looking at in particular
is this stuff here, where all of the Table

80
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:09,028
boarders and other stuff are what you most
see, whereas, what you actually most care

81
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:14,087
about, is the data in the survey, and, so,
if you get rid of, all of the extra lines,

82
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:20,031
and chart junk, it could be clear to see,
the parts that you carried most about.

83
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:25,082
Here's a log in screen that I think does a
nice job in keeping the email address in

84
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:31,006
one place because it's right up to here
and then you get to say whether or not

85
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:36,011
you're a returning customer or a new
customer. If you're a returning customer

86
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:41,055
you enter your password or if you're a new
customer, like the screen shows here, you

87
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:48,002
create a new password and then type it in
and go on from there By contrast, this

88
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:52,099
flight search website has the exact same
information, number of stops, in two

89
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:58,015
separate places And it's possible that
this increased clarity. However, there is

90
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:03,051
a cost of complexity, and there's also a
cost of vertical screen real estate, where

91
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:08,067
by listing the same thing twice, you're
pushing other stuff down. Often by being

92
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:13,096
dynamic about what you show or figuring
out how to show things just once, you can

93
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:19,032
have all of the relevant information fit
more clearly and in a less cluttered way

94
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:25,058
on the screen. One of the easiest conceits
to make as a design team is that the

95
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:30,067
people using your site will care as deeply
and will want to spend as much time Using

96
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:35,006
the site as you've spent building the site
And so it can be easy to have feature

97
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:39,045
creep and lots of bells and whistles and
do dads But that's not necessarily what

98
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:43,056
people want. Here's an example of a
student loan website that offers you the

99
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:47,074
ability to add widgets to your home
screen. Now this is the kind of site that

100
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:52,012
you log into probably a couple times a
year? [laugh] It's not likely to be a site

101
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:57,069
that you're going to want to [inaudible]
with all sorts of gadgets. Next let's talk

102
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:04,006
about helping users recog nize diagnose
and recover from errors. One of the first

103
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:10,059
steps of doing this is making the problem
clearer, here's a hotel reservation site

104
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:18,085
where all it says is: mistake, month,
back. It's hard to know what to do. Here's

105
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:23,073
one that's a little bit better. It's a
registration site for an event. And what

106
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:28,086
we see here is that it says you must fill
out all the required fields. Okay, that's

107
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:34,011
a little better But which fields didn't I
fill out? This page is screens and screens

108
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:39,018
long. There's lots and lots of things that
need to be checked. Which of the myriad

109
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:44,037
things on this page did I forget to check?
Maybe you could show me just a page that

110
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:49,069
has the one or two things forgotten rather
than the whole pile of stuff and force me

111
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:55,090
to scroll through it again. Here's a
dialogue box that shows the error and

112
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:01,009
explains it clearly, but it doesn't offer
you much in terms of solving the problem.

113
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:05,090
It says that there's not enough space on
your iPod, too bad. A more effective

114
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,090
solution would be to offer some view into
what's taking up all the space, or to

115
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,097
offer reasonable ways of limiting the
amount of media that you're trying to put

116
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:20,084
on the device so that it can all fit And
in this particular case, more recent

117
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:25,081
versions of this application handle this
problem better. A common mistake in

118
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:31,058
writing error messages is to offer one
dialogue box for all of the possibilities.

119
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,064
Here's a screen shot of trying to open a
file where it doesn't know the file type.

120
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:42,091
And it says, the application that you
chose, null, could not found. Check the

121
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:48,038
file name, or choose another application.
Well this would be a whole lot better if

122
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:53,094
we were speaking the user's language. Null
may not be the best choice And also if we

123
00:10:53,094 --> 00:11:00,000
offered up a reasonable application for
that file type. A lot of common tasks on

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,045
the web are search based tasks. So here's
a screenshot from searching for a flight.

125
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:10,061
Where the constraint specified yielded no
possible solution For complex search

126
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:15,031
tasks. If a user specifies an unreasonable
set of constraints, one of the most

127
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:20,019
powerful things that you can do as a des
igner is to offer a relaxation of those

128
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,020
constraints that makes this more workable.
Many years ago, I worked with Chuck Rich

129
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,009
at Mitsubishi Research in Boston And he
was working on a research system called

130
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:34,042
Collagen that would find ways to
intelligently relax these constraints.

131
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:39,013
Among other things, to help users get
their work done better. And this kind of

132
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:44,022
smart relaxation can be a really powerful
technique. I wanted to end talking about

133
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:49,037
errors on a good note. Here's a web
browser dialogue box that lets you know if

134
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:54,028
you go to a URL that it believes to be
suspect, it will let you know that you

135
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:59,050
probably don't wanna be here And it offers
to get you outta here and explain more

136
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,076
about why this webpage was blocked.
There's probably future further

137
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:09,011
innovations that could happen in this kind
of error work But I think that this is a

138
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:14,024
pretty good darn start and a lot better
than the way things used to be And that

139
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:20,070
brings us to our last heuristic, which is
better help and documentation. It can be

140
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,070
easy to think about help as somebody
else's problem and not part of the real

141
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,002
App. Fortunately, I think on the web, help
and documents have become more integrated.

142
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:35,088
One of my favorite examples for this is
learning programming systems where

143
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:41,001
websites like PHP, .NET can help you learn
programming systems by providing new

144
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:46,029
examples. Here is another example driven
strategy from UPS's website. It offers you

145
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,093
the opportunity to subscribe to a number
of mailing lists And if you wonder what

146
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:55,028
each of these mailing lists might give
you; on another screen I watched them

147
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:59,086
together here. It will show you examples
from each of those mailing lists of the

148
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:04,066
content you are likely to receive. That's
a really powerful kind of preview strategy

149
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:09,041
And here is an example of a print dialogue
box to tell you what the problem is, but

150
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:15,032
doesn't help you find the solution. For
starters, I think somebody wants to know,

151
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:20,029
is the stuff that's outside the margins
relevant? Is it just formally outside the

152
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:25,007
margins, but nothing's actually getting
cut off, or is there important document p

153
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:30,017
arts that I care about that are being cut
off from the page? And, what do you think

154
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:34,089
the most reasonable path is to solving
this problem? Should I change the page

155
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:39,048
size, or orientation, or move the header
and footer? Help me solve it. Here's a

156
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:43,078
dialogue box for the photo merge feature
of Adobe's Photoshop elements, which is a

157
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:47,088
very cool feature if you set it up right.
However you need to specify multiple

158
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:52,014
photos as input from the project bin And
this is something that the dialogue box

159
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:56,055
actually could do a better job of leading
you through. It could then say let me show

160
00:13:56,055 --> 00:14:01,021
you and it could highlight the project bin
on the screen or something like that. Here

161
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:06,091
are two screenshots from eBay Unless we
have an interesting approach, where eBay

162
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:11,069
has built its own internal messaging
system. And if for the sake of argument we

163
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:16,053
decide that the right thing to do, and
that the internal messaging is better than

164
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:21,050
directly responding to email. I'm not sure
about that, but we'll go with it for now.

165
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,098
They've done a clever thing, which is,
when you reply, the reply mail address

166
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:30,052
says, hey, use the yellow button, and in
the middle of replying it you can see,

167
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:35,024
oops, I made a mistake. That's right I
need to use the internal messaging system.

168
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:41,036
It's an interesting hack And here's
another screenshot from e-bay on the right

169
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:46,023
hand side where when new functionality is
introduced for example the ability to

170
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:50,079
compare multiple options in your card it
can call that out inside the user

171
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,023
interface And I think the ability to
combine help directly into the user

172
00:14:55,023 --> 00:15:00,004
interface is one of the most exciting
advances in this area And it's something

173
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:05,027
that was last common in previous desktop
applications And here's an example that I

174
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:10,032
think is interesting. This is the
un-subscription dialogue box for a mailing

175
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:15,069
list, and if you click, I receive too many
emails, it says wait, you can change the

176
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:21,000
frequency, and you have the opportunity to
receive mailing list mails at a less

177
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,051
frequent interval. I think that this is an
actually a really nice solution, because

178
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:31,037
sometimes you want to receive some mail,
but not too much. In other cases, maybe

179
00:15:31,037 --> 00:15:35,046
you'll view this as harassing and you'll
wish that you could just be done with this

180
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:39,022
task quickly, but in either case, I
thought it was an interesting and creative

181
00:15:39,022 --> 00:16:16,032
solution. [inaudible] If nobody needs to
know the terms of the licensing agreement

182
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:21,009
that's very reasonable But my hunch is
that the reason these things exist is

183
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:26,042
because they have consequence of some sort
the user should probably be informed about

184
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:31,075
And so if you're designing a site that has
terms for users think about is there a way

185
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:36,064
that you can at least summarize what the
key things somebody's agreeing to are

186
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:41,066
Without having them click through it or
having never even seen or read a lick of

187
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:46,010
the agreement at all And to close on a
positive note, one nice thing that you can

188
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,001
do with help on a website is to help
people have fun Filling out forms can

189
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:54,013
often be really boring, and here's an
example from a hotel website where one of

190
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,005
the options has a little joke on the
inside and so that, and so that bit of

191
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:00,039
levity can help increase the user
experience.
