00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:09,027
There are several different ways that
interfaces can help people think more

2
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:14,083
fluently by distributing the cognition
into artifacts in the world. When

3
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:19,034
interfaces help people distributed
cognition, it can encourage

4
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:25,044
experimentation, it can scaffold learning
and reduce errors through redundancy. It

5
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:31,062
can show only the differences that matter,
it can convert small calculation into fast

6
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:36,086
perception, it can support chunking
specially by experts, it can increase

7
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:42,067
efficiency of interactions and it can
facilitate collaboration. Let's go through

8
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:51,007
this one at a time. Here's now a video
game that, that many of you all know. This

9
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:56,096
is the Tetris video game And there was a
very clever study that David Koresh and

10
00:00:56,096 --> 00:01:02,082
Paul Maglio at UC San Diego ran where they
looked at Tetris players playing Tetris

11
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:07,056
and what they found was really
interesting. In textures as you may know

12
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:12,001
you can use keys to move objects
surrounding the screen and at a certain

13
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:17,012
point you can hit the space bar that drop
the object and try and get a row of field

14
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:21,087
blocks. Moving and rotating pieces on the
screen may seem like a waste of time

15
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:27,005
because you have a limited amount of time
before the block hits the bottom so how do

16
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:33,025
you use that most efficiently? It turns
out that people move the block around the

17
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:39,086
screen more than they in some purely
theoretical sense need to so in essence,

18
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:46,037
I'm trying out different places that the
blocks could go. Maybe this is just for

19
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:51,097
novices that when you're learning Tetris
you need to feel things out but as you

20
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:57,001
become more of an expert that's no longer
the case, exactly the opposite.

21
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:02,082
[inaudible] found that experts actually
rely more heavily on moving objects on the

22
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:07,039
world. And what they were doing is they
were distributing the cognitive effort of

23
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,003
what if scenarios. What if I place it over
here or what if I place it over there? You

24
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:17,002
absolutely can do that in your mind But it
turns that in this case, for most people

25
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:22,012
it's cheaper to do it out in the world to
be able to turn the cognitive task of

26
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:26,084
reasoning about all of the what if
scenarios into a perceptual task of, oh

27
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:31,069
yeah, that block would work perfectly
right there. It saves you the effort of

28
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:37,024
having two in particular mentally rotate
to different pieces to figure out how they

29
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:42,078
would fit into the screen. Here's another
example from the learning sciences. There

30
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:48,005
are called Montesorri Blocks. And what we
have here are beads that provide a

31
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:53,025
physical representation or number
specially for young children. Numbers are

32
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:58,087
really abstract concepts difficult to, to
get your head around and these physical

33
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:04,021
[inaudible] can help the addition,
multiplication and other simple arithmetic

34
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:10,038
operation. So, for example if I'm gonna
take three And multiplied y three to get

35
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:15,071
three squared. Well I can see that I have
three by three, I have a square and I can

36
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:20,050
see that it's compost of nine bids and
there other multiplication options that

37
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,053
you could with these also and by having
this redundant information by taking an

38
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:30,050
abstract concept and redefining it and
making it concrete it can help scaffold

39
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,028
learning and reduce errors. The Montessori
Blocks example and the Tetris example show

40
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:41,092
us the power of providing a visual or
physical instantiation of abstract ideas.

41
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:47,041
So what makes a good representation of
this sort? Well, it, you should show the

42
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:52,063
information that you need and nothing
else. And, what these representation

43
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:58,062
should do is it should enable to kinds of
tasks that users wanna do like comparison

44
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:04,012
and exploration and problem solving. And
if that's seem to abstract or maybe

45
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:10,012
obvious, let's take a look at this example
from the London Underground. This subway

46
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:15,098
map was introduced about a century ago and
it was one of the very first maps to

47
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:21,091
introduce a brand new idea in map design
of abstracting the layout of the tracks

48
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:27,022
from the underlying physical geography.
This London subway map, The map would show

49
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:32,012
what the geography was and so long things
were long and short things were short and

50
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:36,086
if it the tracks wandered because that's
the way that it works and the tracks on

51
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:41,000
the map would wander because that's the
way things worked. And with the

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,087
underground map designers realized was
that. The most common task for subway

53
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:51,040
writers is to figure out how to get from
point A to point B and all of these

54
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,043
additional details of faithfulness to the
underlying topology was getting in the way

55
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:02,096
of that A to B task more than it was
helping it. And so what they did is they

56
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:08,027
stripped that a lot of that unnecessary
detail turning this into vertical,

57
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:13,066
diagonal, and horizontal lines. So there
are some representation between the layout

58
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:18,076
on the map and the lay out on the real
world. North is north, and South is south,

59
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:23,074
and things roughly head in the direction
that they do in the real world but the

60
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:28,085
detail is stripped out and this makes it
much easier to be able to figure out how

61
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:34,001
to get between connections. Another thing
that they did is they introduced a century

62
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:39,011
later we would call a focus plus context
representation for the map. In the center

63
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,097
of London, the subway stations are very
densely packed so that area is expanded

64
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:48,076
out. It consumes more of the map real
estate. As you get out toward the suburbs,

65
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:53,032
the stations are fewer and further
between. As oppose to that taking up 90

66
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:57,050
percent of the map because it's 90 percent
of the space. Those stations are actually

67
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,079
scorned because if you know you need to go
Northeast to a particular station then the

68
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:07,088
exact distance is involved are most of the
time less relevant. Now of course with

69
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:13,030
constitutes of good representation is a
course task specific and so what you can

70
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,066
see is that by making some task easier
like getting from A to B when you know A

71
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:23,082
and B or being able to navigate the center
of London more effectively. You've

72
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:28,085
compromised other tasks and so for
somebody who may need to make decisions

73
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:34,071
about what's tough to get off at based on
some underlying Topography or another task

74
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:39,098
that's compromised is by virtue of the
distance between the stations on the map

75
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:45,010
not lining up between the distances
between the stations in the world. You can

76
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,067
make poor judgments about what's close and
what's far in the center you may believe

77
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:55,067
things are far, far apart when they are
really close and on the suburbs, you may

78
00:06:55,067 --> 00:07:00,035
believe from the map that things are
closer than they actually are And so

79
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:05,067
nearly all representation design is about
fitness to task. Here's a temperature map

80
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:11,015
from the weather underground. It shows the
temperature at each location at bay area,

81
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:16,024
geo-referenced so that the temperature
number is placed right on top of that

82
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:20,069
physical location. What do you think the
benefits and drawbacks of this

83
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:32,025
representation? What's it good for and
what's it a problem for. If you know the

84
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:37,032
physical coordinate that you'd like, the
temperature for say for example what

85
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:42,078
temperature is it along the coast and I
don't care or don't know the exact name of

86
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:49,036
the town. This works incredibly well. It's
also a reasonable interface in some sense

87
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:54,087
for trying to get a [inaudible] of what
are the temperatures like in the area over

88
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:59,079
all I could see for example. As I head
inland the temperature tends to get

89
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:06,035
warmer. There are a lot of ways in which
we could make this better so right now

90
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:12,066
every temperature is shown identically no
matter what temperature it is which means

91
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:18,045
it's hard to scan. I have to read every
single temperature one by one. I could

92
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:24,031
make this better if instead I had the
temperature number somehow the color or

93
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:31,071
size of the temperature, number correspond
to the weather, But if we're going to

94
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:37,098
start mapping the variables of the map to
something like color, we need to be

95
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:43,035
careful to get it right. This is an
example that comes from Edward Tufte. His

96
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:48,080
books on Visual Design and the Graphical
representations of data are fantastic and

97
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,026
I strongly encourage you to read them. In
this map, we see how a computer scientist

98
00:08:55,026 --> 00:09:02,021
might make a mapping for Japan. This is
showing the height above or below sea

99
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:09,069
level as color and what you can see is the
depth below sea level is represented by

100
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:16,019
the color spectrum Roy G. By now, one of
the challenges of hue is that it's not an

101
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:22,027
additive representation. So, so it's not
really a strong ordering that we give to

102
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:28,050
the colors perceptually. Its substitute of
representation that red and yellow are

103
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,007
qualitativ ely different but we don't
automatically have a more than or less

104
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:40,000
than relationship between the two, Another
problem on this representation is, it's

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,042
very difficult by gland to tell what's
higher and what's lower in the sea.

106
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:54,050
Conversely the individual isosurfaces, the
individual Chunks of this particular depth

107
00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:00,070
really pop out like to me for example, the
yellow depth pops out very strongly and

108
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,089
that shape really comes to the attention
for which if you are making a rock and

109
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:12,055
roll poster for the Fillmore would be
awesome but if you're trying to get a

110
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:18,030
sense of the contour of the sea, what
become salient to you, the outlines for

111
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:23,056
what's 400 meters below sea level. It
probably just not that relevant so how

112
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:29,001
could we continue our theme of using color
as representational queue but how that be

113
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:34,040
more meaningful than you might see in this
case where we're mapping it to the color

114
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,091
spectrum. And here's Edward Tufte's
redesign which I think is much better.

115
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:45,044
There's a couple of things that I really
like about the representation here. The

116
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:51,010
first one is the all of the things that
are above sea level are brown, are kind of

117
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:56,062
an earth tone. So, we're leveraging our
intuitions about physical world and using

118
00:10:56,062 --> 00:11:02,028
that metaphorically for the map. So, the
land colored stuff is and similarly all of

119
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:08,076
the water is blue, the water-colored stuff
is water. And further more we can see how

120
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:15,088
the intensity or the luminance of that
color blue changes with depth and the

121
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:22,015
deeper blues are darker blues. Which
corresponds to our physical intuitions and

122
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:27,047
of course, water doesn't really get that
much darker at that kind of depth that

123
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:32,072
we're talking about here. Our intuition
about darker colors being deeper comes

124
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:38,010
from much shallower depths but the idea,
you can leverage this thing that we all

125
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,055
know that water right by the shore is, is
a paler color and as you get more of it,

126
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:48,093
it, it gets darker. So, this is a really
wonderful way to see that these darker

127
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:54,072
areas here are deeper than the shallow
areas here. With the lower underground

128
00:11:54,072 --> 00:12:00,026
map, we saw how the representation of the
map, what makes a good representation was

129
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:06,055
intrinsically tied up with the task that
the user is doing. Similarly, what makes a

130
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:12,001
good representation is also dependent on
what a user's expertise is. And a

131
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:18,022
wonderful example of this comes from Herb
Simon and David Chase in the early 1970s.

132
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:24,050
They were looking at chess as an exemplar
domain for trying to understand expertise.

133
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,077
One of the things that they observed was
that expert chess players were much better

134
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:36,085
at being able to remember the
configuration of a chess board. You can

135
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:42,078
imagine a couple hypotheses for this. So,
one of them would be experts were born

136
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:48,041
with a better memory for that kind of
thing or similarly, experts by virtue of

137
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:54,026
their ten thousand hours of training have
trained themselves up to build up that

138
00:12:54,026 --> 00:13:00,004
muscle and be very good at remembering
that kind of thing. Now this turns out to

139
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:05,083
be the case. Experts are much better at
remembering a configuration of the board.

140
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:14,025
[sound] But only if it's an actual game so
if the configuration of the chest board is

141
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:20,019
the configuration of the chest board could
be exports to a fantastic job of

142
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:26,060
remembering But if you arranged the pieces
on the board in a way that chest plate

143
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,054
could not ever achieve, the experts
actually do know better than analysis at

144
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:38,041
all. And so what we're seeing is that the
ability of experts to chunk things and

145
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:44,033
have higher memory capacity is because
they are able to leverage their knowledge

146
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:50,003
about the domain. Game design or user
interface design are both concerned with

147
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:55,014
how easy or hard is it for a user to
accomplish a particular task. The

148
00:13:55,014 --> 00:14:01,013
difference is often designers wanna make
it hard, the right hard and the interface

149
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:07,002
game designers wanna make it that things
easy And so we can learn from this chest

150
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:12,000
example and we can ask the question to
interface designers, can we make

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,054
interfaces more chunkable? Can we make
interactions that can be accomplished in

152
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:23,029
one chunk? And therefore replace a lower
load on our memory and make it easier for

153
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,091
users to work with. A great example of
this comes from Bill Buxton who looked at

154
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:34,064
being abl e to move text between locations
on a document. And in a common desktop

155
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:41,009
user interface today one common operation
will either keyboard short cuter and menu

156
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:47,017
command to cut some texts and then you
move the cursor to a new location and you

157
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:52,054
paste that text. That's three different
operations and in between, if you got

158
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:57,014
interrupted, you might forget what's in
the copy [inaudible]. In fact, I'm sure

159
00:14:57,014 --> 00:15:02,090
that happened to all of us at some point.
What Bobston realized is what if you could

160
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:09,060
turn all of these to a gesture user
interface in the one command. So, maybe I

161
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:16,076
could grab a text that I want. Draw a new
location and drop it right there. That's

162
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:22,037
being much better There's never a time
where I could be interrupted and loose

163
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:27,075
state because all of the state is
maintained in this continuous gesture.

164
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:33,087
We've all heard the saying that pictures
worth ten thousand words. As interface

165
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:40,000
designers, we're tasked with the project
of representing the information to the

166
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,090
user and one task that we commonly have to
deal with is, should we represent

167
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:51,026
information usually? Or should we
represent information textually. The

168
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:57,008
answer of course is it depends but one
time when representing information

169
00:15:57,008 --> 00:16:03,045
visually can be much more effective is
when you can convert slow reasoning tasks

170
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:09,082
into fast perception tasks by virtue of
making them visually salient. We saw that

171
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:16,004
with the map example. In that case, both
the colorings of the map were visual. But

172
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:20,099
one, it was much easier to just add a
glance understand what's going on in good

173
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:26,007
coloring. And the fore coloring, you have
the reason about it much more slowly and

174
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:31,001
the wrong things kept popping out. If you
think about a table of numbers, it can

175
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:36,002
often be difficult to see trends whereas
if you represent that same information

176
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:40,059
visually, it can often pop out what the
high points, the low points, trends,

177
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:44,098
outlines, all of that becomes salient and
automatically visible to you.
