1
00:00:01,027 --> 00:00:06,030
In this video I’d like to talk about the power of creating and comparing alternatives.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,072
And to do that I’m going to share some research

3
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:13,057
that Steven Dow did as a postdoctoral scholar with me at Stanford University.

4
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:21,093
When you’re designing, does it make more sense to go for quality and try to come up with the best possible design?

5
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:29,013
Or does it make more sense to go for quantity first as a path to try and learn and understand?

6
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:34,096
There’s a story that Bayles and Orland tell about an art teacher who divides the class in half,

7
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:37,004
and he tells one half of the class,

8
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:42,077
“You’re going to be graded exclusively on the quality of the very best thing that you make.”

9
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:44,055
He tells the other half of the class,

10
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:48,028
“You’re going to be graded on the quantity of things that you make.

11
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:52,044
Doesn’t matter how good it is; all that matters is how much that you make.”

12
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:57,079
And what this teacher found was that while the quantity group was busily churning our piles of work —

13
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,084
and learning from their mistakes —

14
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:02,061
the quality group sat around theorizing, and at the end of the day

15
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:07,070
they had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and piles of dead clay.

16
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:14,009
So this gives us some intuition that rapidly producing many alternatives has a lot of value.

17
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:19,009
And to explore this further, Steven and I had people create egg drop devices.

18
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,009
You may have done this when you were in high school.

19
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:23,089
If you haven’t, it’s a lot of fun, and I suggest trying it out.

20
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:25,070
And what you can do with an egg drop device,

21
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,028
is you’re building a contraption that will protect an egg from a fall.

22
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:36,043
Here we threw one out my third-story office window and, lo and behold, the egg survives.

23
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:42,008
And we tested a whole bunch of people in variance of this design and people come up with all sorts of stuff.

24
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:47,058
They come up with good ideas, and bad ideas, and creative solutions, and really unimaginative ones.

25
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:50,045
And one thing that is really interesting is that,

26
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:58,047
in aggregate, people often pick one idea early on, and they stick with it to their detriment.

27
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:02,058
And so here is a couple participants talking about that experience.

28
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:07,039
(No, I don’t know, for some reason this is… this seems to be the only idea,

29
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,016
in that there needs to be a platform and then it’s going to cushion, if possible, with the materials.

30
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,028
I… I don’t see any, any other way.

31
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:21,097
>> I’m not a very good outside-the-box thinker, so I kind of just had one idea and I was going to try and make it work.

32
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:27,051
>> I kind of went with the whole parachute idea, and what I had from the beginning. So.

33
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:33,024
>> This is the best approach for such a design.)

34
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:38,097
What we see here is an example of what Karl Duncker called “functional fixation.”

35
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:44,058
In a number of experiments that he ran in the 1940’s he gave people tasks like this:

36
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:50,010
“Attach the candle to the wall such that none of the wax drips on the table.”

37
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,035
Ten, twenty percent of the people figured it out.

38
00:02:53,035 --> 00:03:03,024
Take a moment and see if you can figure it out.

39
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:07,066
The solution — as a couple of you have got, but I bet many people didn’t —

40
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:13,049
is to take the box that holds the tacks and use that as a container for the candle.

41
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,061
That will protect the wax from dripping on the table.

42
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:24,023
And what’s interesting about this is that, because the tacks are in a box, we don’t see the box.

43
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:29,063
If you give people the exact same set up, where the tacks are outside the box,

44
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:33,085
all of a sudden the box becomes obviously available as a resource

45
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:37,007
and nearly everybody solves exactly the same problem.

46
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,046
So Stephen and I set off and tried to figure out

47
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:44,078
whether we could augment people’s design process to get them to explore more alternatives.

48
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:49,053
And one of the things that we did, is we forced people to come up with multiple alternatives in parallel.

49
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:52,016
We call this parallel prototyping,

50
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:58,065
and in this particular study we had people design graphical advertisements for the web.

51
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:01,050
So, we’re going to put people in one of two conditions:

52
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:07,082
You’re either going to be in a serial condition, where you iteratively create six prototypes from start to finish;

53
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:13,063
or in a parallel condition, where you create three alternatives, get feedback, create two more,

54
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:16,008
get feedback, and then make a final one.

55
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:20,083
I should clarify that the amount of time that was available was exactly the same in both conditions,

56
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:24,050
and in both conditions people got exactly the same amount of feedback.

57
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,063
The only difference is when and how they got it.

58
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:33,070
And, again, people come up with all sorts of stuff: Creative ideas and crummy ideas,

59
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:41,092
well executed and poorly executed, and, overall, we’re able to measure, using web analytics,

60
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:46,061
the click-through rate that people clicked on these advertisements.

61
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:52,058
And so, over the past several years, we’ve run millions of advertisements out on the web.

62
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:57,086
And what we see, in aggregate, is that participants who got a parallel design medicine —

63
00:04:57,086 --> 00:05:02,080
who were forced to create multiple alternatives in parallel — had a higher click-through rate:

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,016
The ads they created were clicked on more than ads in the serial condition.

65
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:13,024
And not only that, but the people who clicked on those ads and then went to the site subsequently

66
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:16,032
spent a whole lot more time on that site

67
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:21,050
and what this is telling us is that we’re getting the right people through to those ads.

68
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:27,079
We also had experts — both advertising professionals and clients for this website —

69
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:34,017
rate the quality of the advertisements and the experts also rated the quality of the parallel ads to be higher.

70
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:38,072
And then we had the ads rated by a crowd online for the diversity of the ads.

71
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:42,059
And what we see is that the ads in the parallel condition are also more diverse.

72
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:48,062
And so why does a parallel approach yield better results?

73
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:53,075
I think one of the important things that creating multiple alternatives in parallel does,

74
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:56,090
is it separates your ego from the thing that you make.

75
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:02,065
If I have only one idea and you critique it, I’m going to treat that as feedback about me;

76
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:06,041
whereas if I have multiple different ideas and I get critique about them,

77
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:12,014
I can see that its feedback about the ideas and not a referendum on me as a person,

78
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:18,008
Also, automatically, by creating multiple alternatives, people are inspired to compare what they’ve created

79
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:23,021
and try and transfer what they’ve learned from one design as they go forward in the future.

80
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:27,017
And we see this transfer across a wide variety of domains.

81
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:30,084
For example, in Dedre Gentner’s research on business negotiation,

82
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:34,052
she had participants read business school cases,

83
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:40,028
and she either had people read the cases one at a time and think about each individually,

84
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:44,055
or she had people read them two at a time and compare them.

85
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:49,021
And what she found was that having people compare two cases —

86
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:53,005
to be able to contrast them and see similarities —

87
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:58,080
yielded to a three-fold increase in the amount of wisdom that they were able to get

88
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,050
out of those cases and transfer to a new negotiation task.

89
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:10,040
So, what we got out of this is that maybe there’s some big benefits of creating multiple alternatives,

90
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,097
especially for design teams and not just for individual design.

91
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:18,092
So the next experiment we ran looked at sharing multiple alternatives.

92
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,084
Same basic idea — we have a new client this time.

93
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:27,004
And we’re going to have people either create and share multiple,

94
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:29,042
create multiple and share their best,

95
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:32,031
or create and share only one.

96
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:35,075
Participants came up with lots of different designs.

97
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:42,032
And [what] you can see is that the “share multiple” condition drastically outperforms the other two conditions.

98
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:48,025
So being able to create and share multiple designs has especially significant benefits for teams.

99
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:50,082
And there are a number of reasons for this.

100
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:55,011
I’d like to point out one in particular, which is the increase in group rapport.

101
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:59,074
When we asked people how they felt about their teammate, both before and after the task,

102
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:06,078
in the create- and share-one conditions, people felt worse about their teammate afterwards —

103
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:13,090
the single design approach can create enmity between teammates, and hostility —

104
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:19,040
whereas, when creating and sharing multiple designs, people felt better about their teammates afterwards.

105
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:25,028
One important benefit of sharing multiple designs, both with users and with designers,

106
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:30,089
is that alternatives provide a vocabulary for talking about the space of possible designs.

107
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:35,007
As Tohidi and colleagues showed, this could be especially valuable for users

108
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:38,022
because users don’t know what the space of possible designs is.

109
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:42,040
And so having multiple alternatives gives this vocabulary.

110
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:46,055
I hope that today’s lecture has provided you with the conceptual tools

111
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:49,049
for why it’s valuable to create many different alternatives.

112
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:53,030
And I hope that this will be really useful for you as you go about your design projects.

113
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,064
I’ll see you next time.
