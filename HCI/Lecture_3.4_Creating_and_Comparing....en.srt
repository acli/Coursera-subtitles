1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:05,058
In this video I would like to talk about
the power of creating and comparing

2
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:10,075
alternatives And to do that I'm going to
share some research that Steven Dow did as

3
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:15,034
a post doctoral scholar with me at
Stanford University. When you're

4
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:20,081
designing, does it make more sense to go
for quality and try to come up with the

5
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:26,049
best possible design? Or does it make more
sense to go for quantity first as a, as a

6
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:31,034
path to try and learn and understand?
There's a story that Bayles and Orland

7
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:36,015
tell about an art teacher who divides the
class in half, and he tells one half of

8
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:40,060
the class, you're going to be graded
exclusively on the quality of the very

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,022
best thing that you make. He tells the
other half of the class; you're going to

10
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:49,097
be graded on the quantity of things that
you make. Doesn't matter how good it is,

11
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:54,074
all that matters is how much that you make
And what this teacher found was that while

12
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:58,091
the quantity group was busily churning our
piles of work and learning from their

13
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:03,003
mistakes, the quality group sat around
theorizing, and at the end of the day they

14
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:07,036
had little more to show for their efforts
than grandiose theories and piles of dead

15
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:12,024
clay. So this gives us some intuition that
rapidly producing many alternatives has a

16
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:17,010
lot of value. And to explore this further,
Steven and I had people create, [sound],

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,055
egg drop devices. You may have done this
when you were in high school. If you

18
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:26,035
haven't, it's a lot of fun, and I suggest
trying it out And what you can do with an

19
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:30,074
egg drop device, we're building a
contraption that will protect an egg from

20
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:35,025
a fall. Here we threw one out my third
story office window and low and behold,

21
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:40,035
the egg survives. And we tested a whole
bunch of people in variance of this design

22
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:45,015
and people come up with all sorts of
stuff. They come up with good ideas, and

23
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:50,001
bad ideas, and creative solutions, and
really unimaginative ones And one thing

24
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:55,031
that is really interesting is that in
aggregate people often pick one idea early

25
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:59,041
on and they stick with it to their
detriment. So here is a couple

26
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,095
participants talking about that
experience. >> Y ou know, no, I don't know

27
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:09,032
for some reason this is this seems to be
the only idea. [inaudible] There needs to

28
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:14,035
be a platform and then it's good for
cushion as possible with the materials. I,

29
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:19,091
I don't see any, any other way. >> I move,
not a very good outside the box thinker. I

30
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:25,040
kind of just had one idea and I was going
to try and make it work. >> I kind of went

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,076
with the whole parachute idea, and what I
had from the beginning so. >> [inaudible]

32
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:36,032
This is the best approach for such a
design. What we see here is an example of

33
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:42,027
a Karl Duncker called Functional Fixation.
In a number of experiments that he ran in

34
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:48,008
the 1940's he gave people tasks like this
Attach the candle to the wall such that

35
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:53,003
none of the wax drips on the table. Ten,
twenty percent of the people figure it

36
00:02:53,003 --> 00:03:04,024
out. Take a moment and see if you can
figure it out. [sound] The solution, as a

37
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:10,017
couple of you have got, but many people
didn't. Is to take the box that holds the

38
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:15,053
tacks and use that as a container for the
candle. That'll protect the wax from

39
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:20,047
dripping on the table. And what's
interesting about this, is that, because

40
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:26,024
the tacks are in the box, we don't see the
box. If you give people the exact same set

41
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:31,080
up, where the tacks are outside the box,
all of a sudden the box becomes obviously

42
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,009
available as a resource and nearly
everybody solves exactly the same problem.

43
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:41,014
So Stephen and I set off and tried to
figure out whether we could augment

44
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:45,053
people's design process to get them to
explore more alternatives. And one of the

45
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:49,091
things that we did, is we forced people to
come up with multiple alternatives in

46
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:53,086
parallel. We call this parallel
prototyping, and in this particular study

47
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:59,028
we had people design graphical
advertisements for the web. So, we're

48
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:03,073
going to get, put people in one of two
conditions. You're either going to be in a

49
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:07,090
serial condition, where you iteratively
create six prototypes from start to

50
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,002
finish, or in a parallel condition, where
you create three alternatives, get

51
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:16,008
feedback, create two more, get feedback,
and then make a final one. I should

52
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:20,054
clarify that the amount of time that was
available was exactly the same in both

53
00:04:20,054 --> 00:04:25,004
conditions, and in both conditions, people
got exactly the same amount of feedback.

54
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:31,042
The only difference is when and how they
got it And again people come up with all

55
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:37,025
sorts of stuff. Creative ideas and crummy
ideas, well executed and poorly executed,

56
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:43,016
and overall we're able to measure, using
web analytics, the click-through rate that

57
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:49,020
people clicked on these advertisements and
so, over the past several years we've run

58
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,054
millions of advertisements out on the web.
And what we see in aggregate is that

59
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:59,023
participants that got a parallel design
medicine, who were forced to create

60
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:04,018
multiple alternatives in parallel, had a
higher click-through rate. The ads they

61
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:09,018
created were clicked on more than ads in
the serial condition, and not only that.

62
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:14,008
But the people who clicked on those ads
and then went to the site subsequently,

63
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:19,023
spent a whole lot more time on that site
and what this is telling us is that we're

64
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:24,056
getting the right people through to those
ads. We also had experts, both advertising

65
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:28,072
professionals and clients for this
website; rate the quality of the

66
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:33,068
advertisements and the experts also rated
the quality of the parallel ads to be

67
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:38,060
higher. And then we had the ads rated by a
crowd online for the diversity of the ads.

68
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,025
And what we see is that the ads in the
parallel condition are also more diverse.

69
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:50,042
And so why does a parallel approach yield
better results? I think one of the

70
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:54,085
important things that creating multiple
alternatives in parallel does, is it

71
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:59,051
separates your ego from the thing that you
make. If I have only one idea and you

72
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:03,094
critique it, I am going to treat that as
feedback about me. Whereas if I have

73
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:08,037
multiple different ideas and I get a
critique about them, I can see that its

74
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:12,039
feedback about the ideas, and not a
referendum on me as a person, Also,

75
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,062
automatically, by creating multiple
alternatives, people are inspired to

76
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:21,039
compare what they've created and try and
transfer what they've learned from one

77
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,031
design as they go forward in the future
And we see this transfer across a wide

78
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:31,065
variety of domains. For example, in Dedra
Genter's research on business negotiation,

79
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:37,032
she had participants, read business school
cases, and she either had people read the

80
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:42,066
cases one at a time, and think about each
individually, or she had people read them

81
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:48,037
two at a time and compare them. And what
she found was that having people compare

82
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:54,051
two cases to be able to contrast them and
see similarities yielded to a three-fold

83
00:06:54,051 --> 00:07:00,065
increase in the amount of wisdom that they
were able to get out of those cases and

84
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:06,007
transfer to a new negotiation task. So,
what we got out of this is that, maybe

85
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:11,025
there's some big benefits of creating
multiple alternatives Especially for

86
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:16,065
design teams and not just for individual
design. So the next experiment we ran

87
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:22,099
looked at sharing multiple alternatives.
Same basic idea we have a new client this

88
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:28,053
time And we're going to have people either
create and share multiple, create and

89
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:34,007
share their best, or create and share only
one. Participants came up with lots of

90
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:39,041
different designs. And that you can see is
that the share multiple condition

91
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:44,005
drastically outperforms the other two
conditions. So being able to create and

92
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:48,087
share multiple designs has especially
significant benefits for teams. And there

93
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:54,034
are a number of reasons for this. I'd like
to point out one in particular, which is

94
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:59,047
the increase in group rapport. When we
asked people how they felt about their

95
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:04,074
teammate, both before and after the task.
In the create and share one conditions,

96
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:10,014
people felt worse about their teammate
afterwards. The single design approach can

97
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:14,094
create enmity between teammates, and
hostility, Whereas, when creating and

98
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:20,007
sharing multiple designs, people felt
better about their teammates afterwards.

99
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,092
One important benefit of sharing multiple
designs, both with users and with

100
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:29,082
designers, is that alternatives provide a
vocabulary for talking about the space of

101
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:33,083
possible designs. As [inaudible] and
colleagues showed, this could be

102
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:38,014
especially valuable for users because
users don't know what the space of

103
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:42,010
possible designs is. And so having
multiple alternatives gives this

104
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,036
vocabulary. I hope that today's lecture
has provided you with the conceptual tools

105
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:50,022
for why it's valuable to create many
different alternatives And I hope that

106
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:54,034
this will be really useful for you as you
go about your design projects. I'll see

107
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,005
you next time.
