1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:04,073
I’d like to talk [about] an amazing creature: people.

2
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:07,075
In life, people are often seeking information.

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:12,095
That led to psychologist George Miller to describe people as “informovores”.

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:19,078
Informovores try to find and devour information, much like foragers seek and devour food.

5
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:25,039
And both informovores and foragers are trying figure out how to get lots of it quickly.

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,079
Pete Pirolli, a research scientist at PARC — and his colleagues — has spent more than a decade

7
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,030
trying to figure out what features of information resources help or hinder

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,003
people’s ability to find out what they want.

9
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:43,010
One of the major attributes that informovores use to guide their searching

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,009
is what we call the “scent” of information:

11
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,095
As we browse the web, we’re using cues of the pages that we look at

12
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:57,034
to try and figure out whether we can get to the information we want from where we are,

13
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:59,087
whether it’s trustworthy, whether it’s solving a problem.

14
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:05,079
And we’re also looking at these cues to figure out what options are available to us.

15
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:10,070
If you have a web page and you’d like to know whether the “scent” on the page is poor

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,051
for the people that come to that page or site, there are several telltale signs:

17
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:21,034
If you watch people  use your site, you can see them flail around when they get to a particular page;

18
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:24,013
they don’t know where to go.

19
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:26,038
Another technique — and one that Jared Spool and colleagues

20
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:31,014
have used successfully in user interface engineering — is to look at people’s confidence

21
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:37,022
as to whether they are on the right track, right before and right after they click a link.

22
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:43,052
Before tells you whether the link that you’re looking at is a good one — whether it has high “scent”.

23
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:47,031
And people’s confidence after tells you whether the page that you land on

24
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:52,030
beacons the information that you’re trying to get to.

25
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,041
Another great way to tell when people are having trouble

26
00:01:55,041 --> 00:02:00,051
with the scent  of information in how to follow the trail is the use of the Back button.

27
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:05,031
Lots of use of the Back button — major problems for your navigation.

28
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:12,033
Here’s an example of a menu bar of a web page that I think exhibits particularly low scent.

29
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:17,063
This is the menu bar for the Stanford Federal Credit Union — a bank.

30
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:19,086
To give you a feel of what it looks like [interactively],

31
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:24,079
if you mouse over  any of these navigational elements, you’ll get a second level of navigation.

32
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:30,059
However, even with that second layer, this page exhibits many of the scent problems

33
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:33,067
that I think are common for low-scent pages.

34
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:37,029
For starters, the categories aren’t written in terms

35
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:41,036
that I think most of the people that come to the site are familiar with.

36
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:48,031
It’s hard to figure out what’s behind “LoanClick” or “Transact”.

37
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:51,002
This is my bank, and often when I go to the site,

38
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:59,030
I’ve to try several different options before I figure out which one has the particular page I’m looking for.

39
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,067
Also, the navigational links on this page are short — there’s only a couple of words.

40
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:15,000
And this combination of jargon by the designers as opposed to user-centred terms and the brevity of the links

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,019
makes it very difficult to see behind those links.

42
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:26,032
Also, as we see, a lot of the cues that would help me figure out what’s behind “Transact”

43
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:33,073
or “LoanClick” or “Account View”, those are hidden in a secondary layer of navigation.

44
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:40,047
You [of] course can mouse over one at a time and get to them, but it’s relatively slow.

45
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:46,066
And finally, the designers of the site presumably offered icons for each of the menu elements

46
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:51,099
with the intuition that icons make things better — they provide a picture and pictures are good, right?

47
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:57,006
But these icons don’t provide much additional information.

48
00:03:57,006 --> 00:04:03,012
While good icons can often improve the usability of a site, generic icons rarely help.

49
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:10,034
Another example of generic icons are the web page icons that you see along the left-hand side of this page here,

50
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:14,083
which is the web site for the HCI class online.

51
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:21,026
The generic globe [icon] doesn’t tell me much about the link, so it doesn’t add any information;

52
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:29,074
those pixels could be better put to use with a more specific icon, or with additional words.

53
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:34,037
Icons do help when they facilitate repeat recognition —

54
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:38,071
If either the first time I come to it, it shows me something that I expect;

55
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:43,022
or if it’s a good reminder for when I return.

56
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:48,036
Icons are also really helpful when you know what something looks like, but not what it’s called —

57
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:51,037
and that could be because it’s a language you’re not familiar with,

58
00:04:51,037 --> 00:05:00,068
or it could be because there are multiple different terms, and you may not understand which one is being used in this case.

59
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:04,006
And good icons can also help with redundant coding,

60
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:09,008
because if you can recognize either the picture or the word that goes with the icon,

61
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,066
then you’re in business and you can get going,

62
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:15,013
and they can teach you about each other —

63
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:19,065
so I’ll learn what the word means from the “Permit” picture that I might be familiar with,

64
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:26,042
or vice-versa — if I’m familiar with the word, I can learn what the picture is.

65
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:29,058
So how can we improve the scent of links?

66
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:33,098
One of the most effective strategies for improving the scent of your web site

67
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:37,075
is to lengthen the links that you have on the site —

68
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:44,021
As opposed having one short word, add a longer explanation.

69
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:52,008
And when you do this, add specific, recognizable terms — what Jared Spool calls “trigger words” —

70
00:05:52,008 --> 00:06:00,083
and not stuff that’s funny, or clever, or is the terminology favoured by the design team but not the users.

71
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:07,022
Long, specific links titles — like 7 or 8 words — not only can help improve the scent of the website,

72
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:10,000
it can help improve the accessibility,

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,044
because many of your users who’re accessing your site through a screen reader

74
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:20,064
will really value the specificity of those links to be able to understand what’s going on.

75
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:28,043
One example of that is that when the HCI course began, we had a link that I think was called “Grading Policy.”

76
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:36,000
Few people realized that behind that link was where we explained the different tracks of the course:

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,086
And for good reason: the word “track” was nowhere in the link.

78
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:45,019
After a week of confusion on the forum, we realized this

79
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,004
and we’re able to redesign the link to be longer and more specific,

80
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:54,033
and includes multiple different trigger words that might bring people to that page.

81
00:06:57,022 --> 00:07:00,099
Another example from the [intranet] HCI class that I teach at Stanford

82
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:09,074
is we had a video where the link had a really short “here” as the only word in the link.

83
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:15,008
After somebody emailed me asking where the video was — and I knew it was on that page —

84
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:20,010
I realized that I could redesign that link, to expand it out to be multiple words;

85
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:26,076
and since redesigning that link to be longer, nobody’s emailed me saying they had any trouble.

86
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:32,076
One of the biggest impediments to improving the scent of navigational elements on a site

87
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:36,044
is that we have a really good general-purpose impulse

88
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:41,018
to try and not put too much cruft on things and make it too long.

89
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:44,056
However, with navigation, often more is better,

90
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:52,027
and a great strategy for effective navigation is what’s called “speaking block navigation.”

91
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:54,097
And this set of examples, collected by Smashing Magazine,

92
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:59,019
provides a good intuition as to what speaking block navigation is.

93
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:03,081
By adding multiple different words — perhaps subheadings that are underneath the structure,

94
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:07,084
or an explanation of what the main word or catchphrase is —

95
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:14,051
that can help users get to the place that they want to go.

96
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:21,019
When you provide links or content on a page, does it matter where on the page you put them?

97
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,075
Absolutely!

98
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:27,042
And one way that you can see this is with a number of eye-tracking studies

99
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:30,003
that have been done over the last decade or so.

100
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:36,085
This one is compliments of Ed Cutrell from his research group at Microsoft.

101
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:43,024
And what you can see here is that the places on a page where a user looks most

102
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:47,036
are visualized here in red as a “hot spot,”

103
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:53,049
and places where people look less frequently are in blue colours.

104
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,063
The distribution of gaze is remarkable:

105
00:08:55,063 --> 00:09:03,037
A huge fraction of people’s time is spent looking at a relatively small portion of the real estate on the screen,

106
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:09,048
and these are habits that we build up and carry across to multiple different websites.

107
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:14,031
Very cleverly, we’d built up a sense of where the good stuff often is,

108
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:18,085
and we ignore where the bad stuff often is.

109
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:25,032
And you can then use this to design for “glanceability.”

110
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:32,017
The Poynter Institute has produced this diagram which shows where, in general, people mostly look,

111
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:35,009
and these results are for English-language web pages —

112
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:40,089
presumably they generalize to most pages that have a left-to-right reading order.

113
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:46,031
A lot of the key stuff  is in the top-left — that’s the red area.

114
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:51,008
Then there’s a secondary ring around that.

115
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:57,078
And finally, below the fold and off to the far right is where the lowest priority stuff is.

116
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:02,050
Now these priority areas are obviously going to be genre-dependant

117
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,037
and based on an individual user’s expectations;

118
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:14,082
but, as a good heuristic, “top left, more important; as you get lower or further to the right, less important.”

119
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:22,077
So, in short, our prime real estate is above the fold, and it’s in places where people expect to find stuff.

120
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:26,045
So this is going to be where other pages put similar content:

121
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:29,035
If you have pages that your users are familiar with,

122
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:35,094
following the location on screen where they have their navigational elements or prime real estate

123
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:41,056
will help people get used to your site as well.

124
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:45,081
And definitely don’t put the navigational stuff where people expect to see ads,

125
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:54,020
because, by now, many people mostly ignore whatever locations they think is going to be advertising.

126
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,067
While your prime real estate is above the fold,

127
00:10:56,067 --> 00:11:03,092
people are more than happy to scroll if they think that they’re going to see something that’s worthwhile.

128
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:07,098
Often, when there’s valuable information below the fold that people don’t see,

129
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:14,068
it’s because the stuff above the fold didn’t look very good; People assume you’re putting your best stuff there.

130
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:20,076
So, if that’s your best stuff, whatever is got to be below that, that can’t be so good.

131
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:26,027
But if you have lots of great content up top, people will infer that there’s even more further down.

132
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:33,027
And many of the most popular sites on the web see users scroll pretty significantly.

133
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:38,053
Usability expert Jakob Nielsen conducted a study of how people read online,

134
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:45,071
and I can share with you the summary of his results: “They don’t.”

135
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:50,029
Of course there are times where we sit down and read a lengthy article online —

136
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,069
that’s not exactly what we’re talking about here.

137
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:57,003
We’re talking about general-purpose web browsing, when we’re fishing around for information,

138
00:11:57,003 --> 00:12:04,047
and in these cases, it’s extremely rare to find that people will spend a significant amount of time on one site.

139
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:08,064
Often what you’ll see is that people have a number of tabs open simultaneously,

140
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:12,048
and they’re even doing totally unrelated tasks simultaneously:

141
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:14,051
So they may search for a while.

142
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:18,023
After a minute or two, email gets exciting; go to that.

143
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:26,048
Come back, look across multiple different sites at once, and all of this time they’re trying to find relevant information.

144
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:32,038
So what this means is that the successful sites are the ones that support this interlaced browsing

145
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:40,074
as effectively as is possible by bubbling up the most important stuff.

146
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:44,040
And Jakob Nielsen was able to demonstrate the effects of taking this into account

147
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,075
by changing the writing strategy and then measuring the impact on usability.

148
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:56,060
Jakob Nielsen tried three separate techniques to improve the usability of these websites —

149
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,046
making the text more concise;

150
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:05,095
making it more scannable by using subheadings, bulleted lists, and short paragraphs;

151
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:11,049
and using more objective language as opposed to what Nielsen calls “marketese.”

152
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:17,035
And what he found was that the effects on the user experience were really significant.

153
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:22,061
The good news is that all of these strategies are really straightforward.

154
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:26,017
And if you’d like to learn more about improving the navigation of websites,

155
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:31,050
I highly recommend these three resources shown here.
