99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I’d like to talk [about] an amazing creature: people.

2
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
In life, people are often seeking information.

3
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That led to psychologist George Miller to describe people as “informovores”.

4
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Informovores try to find and devour information, much like foragers seek and devour food.

5
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And both informovores and foragers are trying to get lots of it quickly.

6
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Pete Pirolli, a research scientist at PARC — and colleagues — has spent more than a decade

7
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
trying to figure out what features of information resources help or hinder

8
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
people’s ability to find out what they want.

9
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
One of the major attributes that informovores use to guide their searching

10
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
is what we call the “scent” of information:

11
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
As we browse the web, we are using cues of the pages that we look at

12
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to try to figure out whether we can get to the information we want from where we are,

13
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
whether it’s trustworthy, whether it’s solving a problem.

14
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And we’re also looking at these cues to figure out what options are available to us.

15
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If you have a web page and you’d like to know whether the “scent” on the page is poor

16
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
for the people that come to that page or site, there are several telltale signs:

17
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If you watch people  use your site, you can see them flail around when they get to a particular page;

18
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they don’t know where to go.

19
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Another technique — and one that Jared Spool and colleagues

20
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
have used successfully in user interface engineering — is to look at people’s confidence

21
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
as to whether they are on the right track, right before and right after they click a link.

22
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Before tells you whether the link that you’re looking at is a good one — whether it has high “scent”.

23
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And people’s confidence after tells you whether the page that you land on

24
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
beacons the informations that you’re trying to get to.

25
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Another great way to tell when people are having trouble

26
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
with the scent  of information in how to follow the trail is the use of the Back button.

27
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Lots of use of the Back button — major problems for your navigation.

28
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Here’s an example of a menu bar of a web page that I think exhibits particular low scent.

29
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is the menu bar for the Stanford Federal Credit Union — a bank.

30
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
To give you a feel of what it looks like [interactively],

31
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
if you mouse over  any of these navigational elements, you’ll get a second level of navigation.

32
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
However, even with that second layer, this page exhibits many of the scent problems

33
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that I think are common for low-scent pages.
