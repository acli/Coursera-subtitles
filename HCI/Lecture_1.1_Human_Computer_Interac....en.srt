00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,050
Hi, I am Scott Klemmer, I’m an associate professor of computer science,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,071
and I’d like to welcome you this online class, introducing human-computer interaction.

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:13,001
This online class is based on the class I’ve been teaching in Stanford for several years now,

4
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:16,036
and it synthesizes materials from a number of sources.

5
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:20,080
First and foremost is the human, the person that’s using the system

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,007
and the other people that they work and communicate with.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:27,011
Then you got the computer, that’s the machine and the networked-up machines that run the system.

8
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:30,066
And then you got the interface that represents the system to the user.

9
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:35,064
HCI is the design, implementation and evaluation of user interfaces.

10
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:39,048
This course is going to teach you a set of tools for doing this effectively.

11
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:43,091
At the onset of the design project, we often don’t know what the problem is

12
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:47,074
or what the space of possibilities might be, let alone what the solution should be.

13
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:50,079
Consequently, real-world design is often iterative,

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,046
failed fast so you can succeed sooner.

15
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:56,096
Often it benefits from trying and comparing options.

16
00:00:56,096 --> 00:01:01,018
Finally, it’s important to focus on the people who are going to use your system.

17
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:05,045
Good design brings people joy: it helps people do things that we care about,

18
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:08,005
and helps us connect people that we care about.

19
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:13,004
Good user interfaces can have a tremendous impact on both [the] individual’s ability to accomplish things,

20
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,082
and societies’. Graphical user interfaces help

21
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:18,040
with computing a hundreds of millions of tasks,

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,097
enabling us to do things like create documents, and share photo and connect with family

23
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:24,096
and find information.

24
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:30,009
Bad design is frustrating and costs lives: medical devices, airplane accidents

25
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,045
and nuclear disasters are just three domains where bad user interfaces and software errors

26
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:38,040
have caused serious injury and many deaths.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,077
These are big ticket items that take a lot of time to produce.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,096
What really gets me is that many of these interface problems

29
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:47,011
could have easily been avoided.

30
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:53,050
Fixing these problems requires following just basic principles like consistency and feedback.

31
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:56,063
If effective principles for interface design were widely known

32
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:59,079
some of these disasters might have been avoided.

33
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:03,065
This is one of the major reasons that I created this course.

34
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:08,014
Bad design causes problems and degrades people[’s] quality of life in many smaller ways too.

35
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:11,010
Think of all the time that you waste on your bank's website

36
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,012
or trying to figure out why the wifi doesn't work, or trying to set something on your digital camera.

37
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:19,065
Let's say these frustrations take

38
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,034
10 minutes a day for the average American.

39
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:28,024
With 300 million people in America alone, that’s 3 billion person-minutes a day.

40
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:31,012
or 18 billion person-hours a year.

41
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:34,095
That's a lot of time that we could’ve spent making the world a better place.

42
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:38,084
Oftentimes, the best interfaces become invisible to us.

43
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:43,086
When an interface becomes automatic by practice, by design and most often by a combination,

44
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:47,095
our attention shifts from manipulating an interface to accomplishing a task.

45
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:51,021
It’s kind of like a blind person who has practiced working with a cane.

46
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:55,030
After all those hours of practice, they no longer feel the cane.

47
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,064
Their sensory perception is at the end of the cane, experiencing the world.

48
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:03,082
That attentional shift is what happens when an interface becomes intuitive.

49
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:08,035
Designing great user interfaces requires enormous creativity and a lot of hard work.

50
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:11,071
But designing pretty good user interface is pretty easy

51
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:15,034
if you know some methods, techniques and principles. I’ll show how.

52
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:18,034
Summarize this introduction:

53
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:22,096
In this course you're going to learn a process where people’s tasks, goals and values drive development.

54
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:26,033
You’re going to learn to work with users throughout the process;

55
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:31,024
to assess decisions from the vantage point of users, their work and their environment;

56
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:36,058
to pay attention to people's abilities and situation; and to talk to the actual experts.

57
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:42,052
You'll learn to talk with a variety of users — both regular and extreme users — and a wide variety of stakeholders.

58
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:45,058
As my colleague John Zimmerman reminded me recently,

59
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,068
users are just one of the many stakeholders in the design process.

60
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:56,011
Other stakeholders matter too, helping ease development and costs of production, support maintenance,…

61
00:03:56,011 --> 00:04:00,028
In designing for people, don't forget the other pieces of the puzzle.

62
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:05,062
In creating this class, I’ve integrated materials from a lot of sources,

63
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:09,006
including classes like James Landay’s, books like Don Noman’s

64
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:12,000
and papers like from the CHI Conferences.

65
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,014
For those who'd like to learn more,

66
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:17,055
I’ve put a Further Reading slide at the end of many of my lectures.
