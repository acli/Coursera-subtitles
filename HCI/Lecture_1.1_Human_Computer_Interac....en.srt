Hi, I am Scott Klemmer, I'm an associate professor

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:09,003
of computer Science. Now I'd like to welcome you this online class, introducing Human-computer interaction

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:13,022
This online class is based on the class I've been teaching in Standford for several years now

4
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:17,037
and sinthesyzes materials from a number of sources

5
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:21,014
First and foremost is the human, the person using the  system

6
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,075
and the other people the work and communicate with.

7
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:27,011
Then you got the computer, that's the machine and the networking machine

8
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:31,005
And then you got the interface that represents the systems to the user

9
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:35,064
HCI is the design, implementation and evaluation of user interfaces.

10
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:39,048
This course is gonna teach you a set of tools for doing this effectively.

11
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:43,091
At the outside of the desing project,we often don't know what the problem is

12
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:48,013
or what the space of possibilities might be, let along with the solution should be.

13
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:51,017
Consequently, real world design is often iterative

14
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,083
fed fast so you can succeed sooner.

15
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:57,030
often the benefits from trying and comparing options.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,018
Finally, it's important to focus on the people who are gonna user your system.

17
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:05,074
Good design brings people joy, it helps people do things that we care about,

18
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:08,068
and helps us connect people that we care about.

19
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:13,004
Good user interface design have a tremendous impact on both individual's ability to accomplish things

20
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,082
and the societies. Graphical user interfaces help

21
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:18,080
with computing a hundreds of millions of tasks.

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,048
Enabling us to do things like create documents, and share photo and connect with family

23
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:25,047
and find information.

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,009
Bad design is frustrating and cost lives, medical devices, airplane accidents

25
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,045
and nuclear disasters are just three domains where bad user interfaces and software errors

26
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:38,069
have caused serious injury and many deaths.

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,077
These are big ticket items that take a lot of time to produce.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,077
What really gets me is that many of these interface problems

29
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:47,060
could have easily been avoided.

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,068
Fixing these problems follow...requires following just basic principles like consistency and feedback

31
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:56,063
If effective principles for interface design were widly known

32
00:01:56,063 --> 00:02:00,022
some of these disasters might have been avoided.

33
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:03,065
This is one of the reasons that I created this course.

34
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:08,014
Bad desing causes problems and degrades people quality of life in many smaller raise too.

35
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:11,069
Think of all the time that you waste on your bank's website

36
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:16,012
or trying to figure out why the wifi doesn't work, or trying to set something on your digital camera.

37
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:19,070
Let's say these frustrations take

38
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:25,026
10 minutes a day for the average american. With 300 million people in America alone

39
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:28,059
that's 3 billion person minutes a day.

40
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:31,025
or 18 billion person hours a year.

41
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:34,095
That's a lot of time that we can spend making the world a better place.

42
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:39,007
Often times, the best interfaces become invisible to us.

43
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:43,086
When an interface becomes automatic by practice, by design and most often by a combination

44
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:47,095
our attention sheds from manipulating an interface to accomplishing a task.

45
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:51,021
It's kind of like a blind person who has practice working with a can.

46
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:55,030
After hours of practice they no longer feel the can

47
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,064
their sensory perception is at the end of the can experiencing the world.

48
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:04,006
That attentional shift is what happens when an interface becomes intuitive.

49
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:07,067
Designing great user interfaces requires enormous creativity,

50
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:10,064
and a lot of hard work. But designing pretty good user interface

51
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:14,062
is pretty easy if you know some methods, techniques and principles.

52
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:18,097
I'll show how, summarize this introduction, in this course

53
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:23,028
you're gonna learn a process where people's tasks, goals and values drive development.

54
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:27,084
You're gonna learn to work with users throughout the process, to assess decisions

55
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:31,024
from the vantage point of users, their work and their environment.

56
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:36,058
To pay attention to people's abilities and situations, and to talk to the actual experts.

57
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:40,064
You'll learn to talk with a variety of users, both regular and extreme users.

58
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:45,058
And a wide variety of stakeholders, as my colleague John Zimmerman reminded me recently,

59
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,068
users are just one of the many stakeholders on the design process

60
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:54,059
Other stakeholders matter too...helping ES development, and cost of production

61
00:03:54,059 --> 00:04:00,028
support maintenance. In designing for people, don't forget the other pieces of the puzzle.

62
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:05,086
In creating this class, I integrated materials from a lot of sources.

63
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:09,006
including classics like James Landay, books like Don Noman's

64
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:12,090
and papers like from the CHI Conferences

65
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,086
For those who'd like to learn more I put

66
00:04:14,086 --> 99:59:59,000
a further reading slide at the end of many of my lectures.
