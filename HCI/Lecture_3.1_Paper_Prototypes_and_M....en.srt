00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:02,090
Hi there, welcome back!

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:08,048
Early on the course, I outlined a design process that favours rapid exploration early on.

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,046
Now let’s learn how to actually accomplish that.

4
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:16,024
In this video, we’ll dive into three techniques for rapidly producing prototypes.

5
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:22,091
Over the course of your project, the fidelity of the prototypes that you create is  going to increase,

6
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:27,029
and you’ll want to pick tools that reflect where you’re at in terms of the design process,

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,094
not using stuff that’s too high-fidelity and too time-consuming early on.

8
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:37,005
So, for example, you might start out by storyboarding, which is the first technique we’ll learn today.

9
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:40,090
That will give you a sense of the tasks and the scenarios you’d like to support.

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,036
Then you might move on to paper prototypes, and from there digital mockups.

11
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:49,033
Then, if you’re in the web domain, some static HTML.

12
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:54,040
And, only then, get dynamic — add in the database and the other fancy parts.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,088
Picking the right tool for the job helps you focus on the questions that you have

14
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,099
at that particular stage of the design process.

15
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:03,061
So, in the video we’re going to talk about storyboarding,

16
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,087
creating and testing paper prototypes,

17
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:08,039
and moving on to digital mockups.

18
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:11,079
One of the easiest mistakes to make in interface design

19
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:18,058
is to focus on the user interface before you focused on the tasks that the interface’s going to support.

20
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:21,065
And, if you got one thing out of storyboarding,

21
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:26,071
the piece to understand is that storyboarding is all about tasks.

22
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:33,063
Here’s an example from the “Lifealyfics” project team from my Stanford HCI class in the Fall of 2011.

23
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:36,074
They were interested in user interfaces for behaviour tracking,

24
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:39,094
and here are a couple of the early storyboards that they produced.

25
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:41,063
What’s nice about a storyboard is

26
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:46,071
in just a few panels you can convey what the user interface will help a person accomplish.

27
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:51,030
And a good storyboard is nearly always going to have an actual person in there.

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,020
Another thing that you can see in these storyboards is that they communicate flow:

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,013
Much like a comic strip, it’s showing what’s happening at key points in time.

30
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:05,017
One of the biggest worries about creating storyboards is that they’d tell me “Ugh, I can’t draw!”

31
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:09,083
But storyboarding isn’t about beautiful drawing; it’s about communicating ideas,

32
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:14,028
and I think that *everyone* can learn how to visually communicate ideas.

33
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:20,032
In some ways, bad drawing is actually an asset, because then all you can do is focus on the content.

34
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:25,026
I said that good storyboards nearly always include a person who’s actually using the interface,

35
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:30,000
and so, to get you started, I’d like to teach you my favourite trick for storyboarding.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,081
I learnt this from Bill Verplank. Bill and I taught together at Stanford for several years.

37
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:40,090
And Bill, [inaudible] for generations, has taught people how to draw “Star People”, and it goes like this:

38
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,086
[Professor Klemmer starts drawing a “star person”]

39
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:46,094
We call it a “star person” because the body of the person is kind of like a star,

40
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:51,059
and you can have them doing all sorts of things, so somebody can be holding something,

41
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:58,045
or they can be reaching up to touch maybe something on a big screen.

42
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,030
You can add any dynamics that you want.

43
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,037
If you need to, you can show where people are looking.

44
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:06,077
If you want, you can distinguish different people in the scenes —

45
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:14,050
so you can colour them in a little bit, or you can add a sheriff’s badge.

46
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,097
And, when you put it all together, you can get something like this.

47
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:22,095
These are some images from the storyboarding guide that we’ve linked from your assignment.

48
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:27,011
One of the very first things a storyboard should do is to illustrate a goal.

49
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,099
Like in this storyboard, it’s “Let’s check out places in SF!”

50
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,005
You can show how a task unfolds, and here you can see some “star people”,

51
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:39,024
and they’re explaining what they’re doing, so here they’s saying “Here we’re in San Francisco.”

52
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:43,056
And by the end of the storyboard you’ll want to show how they accomplished what their goal was,

53
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:48,099
or, in some other way, have a satisfactory outcome at the end of the storyboard.

54
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,097
And as a mall shows,

55
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:55,068
even with a really simple visual language, there’s a whole lot you can do to get your point across.

56
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:58,023
So, storyboards should accomplish three things:

57
00:03:58,023 --> 00:04:02,015
First, it should accomplish the setting: Who are the people involved?

58
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:05,081
what’s the environment? and what tasks are they trying to do?

59
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:12,053
Next, it should show the sequence: What are the steps that they do to accomplish the task? —

60
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:17,021
Not necessarily what user interface’s  exactly where the buttons and widgets are,

61
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:23,028
but what role the user interface plays in helping them get their goal achieved.

62
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:28,071
And one the the first steps is going to be: What leads somebody to use the app?

63
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:34,047
In the mall’s example, that began with somebody saying “Let’s check out places in San Francisco!”

64
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:38,004
That’s the springboard that clearly motivates people to go to the application.

65
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:46,062
And then your app can easily and clearly show what’s the task that the idea you have is supporting.

66
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:49,061
And then finally, at the end, you’ve got the satisfaction —

67
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:53,028
How does what motivated them to use the app in the first place,

68
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:58,063
how does that connect to their achieving that in the end of the sequence?

69
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:02,012
Questions your storyboard can help you think about are:

70
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:06,081
“What is it that enables people to accomplish, and what need does your application fill?”

71
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:10,031
I really like storyboards for their holistic focus;

72
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:14,010
it enables you to think through how you might support a task

73
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,061
without committing to a particular user interface —

74
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:23,020
that’s the magic, and this is especially important when you’re designing as a team,

75
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,020
because the idea that’s in your head may or may not be the same as the idea that’s in somebody else’s head.

76
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,009
Or, you may have this great idea, but people don’t know what you’re talking about yet.

77
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,027
Once you’ve got it out on paper and concrete, it makes it much easier for poeple to have common ground,

78
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:41,001
and agree on how to move forward.

79
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:44,087
When you’re storyboarding, I suggest imposing extremely harsh time limits on yourself,

80
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:47,072
like 10 minutes for a storyboard.

81
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:52,089
It can be easy to try and get everything beautiful even if you’re sketching out with pen and paper,

82
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,082
but that’s not the point!

83
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:58,016
Once you’ve got a rough idea of what your application’s going to accomplish,

84
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:00,095
you can start to think about how you’re going to implement that,

85
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:04,084
and by implement I mean “What’s it going to look and feel like to the user?

86
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:07,037
What’s the actual user interface is going to be?”

87
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:10,055
And for figuring out the user interface at an early stage,

88
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:15,040
the very best technique that I know is to use paper prototyping.

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,009
Paper prototyping is exactly what it sounds like:

90
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,037
You’re going  to make a mockup of the user interface, and, instead of doing it on the computer,

91
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:27,078
which can take a lot of time and encourage you to try to get it beautiful and exact,

92
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:32,073
you’re going to use paper, Post-It notes, and markers, to sketch things out really quickly.

93
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:36,002
Here’s an example, it’s again from the “Lifealyfics” team.

94
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:39,038
These are the paper prototypes that they made:

95
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,076
(Lifealyfics / Discover What Makes You Happy / (Begin)

96
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,006
Here’s How It Works / 1. We’ll send you random texts throughout the day, at the frequency you select. / 2. You input your [illegible] and activity / (Then What?)

97
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:43,039
3. At the end of the week, we’ll send you your results, and you’ll realize what makes you happy and fulfilled! / (Start)

98
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,003
Step 1 of 3 / Enter phone number [text field] / (Next)

99
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,022
The more texts you respond to, the more accurate your personal graph will be! / How many texts per day do you want to receive? [dropdown]

100
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:49,053
Step 2 of 3 / How many times per day do you want to get a text?

101
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,082
Step 2 of 3 / How many times per day do you want to get a text? / (Next)

102
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:53,016
Step 3 of 3 / Earliest text: [dropdown] / Latest text: [dropdown] / (Next) )

103
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:10,058
Here’s some tips for making effective paper prototypes:

104
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:13,024
First, store all your materials in one place.

105
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:20,052
You’re going to want to get a bucket of markers, maybe some Post-It notes or index cards.

106
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:26,018
If you’ve got a mobile device that you’re simulating, you might even make a mockup of something like that,

107
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:29,016
and you can slide in and out different interface widgets.

108
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,060
Just like the storyboards, it’s important to work quickly.

109
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,073
And if you had a widget that you’re going to use a lot of —

110
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:38,029
like  radio buttons or sliders or something like that —

111
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,023
sometimes it can be faster to photocopy them on a photocopier,

112
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:48,082
so you can  make one version and then photocopy it to have a whole bunch.

113
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:52,058
Sometimes, good paper prototyping is kind of like playing make-believe as a kid.

114
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:56,024
So, if you’ve got something that’s complicated or highly interactive,

115
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,030
you can just imagine what it would be like,

116
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,069
and so you can role-play that out with the person who’s trying out your application.

117
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:05,056
It can be helpful to have a frame to put your interface widgets in.

118
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,083
Here we have a mobile frame.

119
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:12,034
You can also stick things right on the device itself,

120
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:16,051
So, if you want to make a mobile screen shot here,…

121
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:24,084
Mobile user interface!

122
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:30,050
Or, if you have a desktop user interface, you can take, like, a 11-by-14  sheet of poster board

123
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,076
and put all  of your elements on that.

124
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:36,021
Good paper prototyping is also like collage — you can mix and match fidelities.

125
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:41,023
So you can use printouts of actual screen shots; draw and annotate on top of that —

126
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:43,098
anything that you want that can get your point quickly.

127
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:46,078
And to help the person who’s trying out the prototype

128
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:51,043
make the conceptual leap between the sketch on paper and an interactive system,

129
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:55,033
you can add in a little widgets and chrome of your user interface

130
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:58,012
to convey that it’s part of a larger operating system.

131
00:08:58,012 --> 00:09:01,083
Paper prototyping is not only fast and efficient;

132
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:08,018
it’s also really fun, and you can get really creative in figuring out different ways to convey interactions.

133
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:12,095
If you’ve got layers in your user interface, you can use transparencies as a way of showing them.

134
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,054
If you have popup menus, you can make the back sticky,

135
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:20,055
so that can stay on the right place on top of the main interface.

136
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,009
You [can] use any kind of marker or pen you want;

137
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:29,019
you can have things be coloured, [or] just black-and-white — Anything you can think of.

138
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:37,001
You can use poster board (like this), or cardboard, index cards, foamcore —

139
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:40,076
anything you want as a backing material.

140
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:43,072
Things like tape are handy to have around.

141
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:49,000
If you’d like to be able to have repeatable user input, you can use whiteboard markers or transparency pens,

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,014
and have a whiteboard or a sheet or transparency that the user input goes on,

143
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:55,081
and then you can take it away when you’re done.

144
00:09:55,081 --> 00:10:00,064
To be able to add structure to your user interface, you can have  line widths of different thicknesses.

145
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:07,044
So, you can have a thicker line that’s for the major elements, and a thinner line for the minor elements.

146
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:15,012
And you can have a stack or either Post-It notes or index cards to show the tab panes of your user interface.

147
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:19,039
So, the different layers can be on sheets beneath.

148
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,034
Here you can see a wonderful widget from the “Lifealyfics”   team,

149
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:27,001
where they’ve created a sliding window inside a mobile phone mockup

150
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:32,023
as a way of conveying how something would change over time and in response to user input.

151
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:35,092
The other thing that I’m going to show here, and I’ll touch on several times in this course,

152
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:39,033
is the importance of trying out multiple different alternative prototypes

153
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:42,019
as a way of getting more valuable feedback from the user.

154
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:48,037
So, here are different ways that you could present the data that a live logging  system is gathering.

155
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:52,039
Another reason I really like paper prototyping is that *everybody* can be involved.

156
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,066
So, if you try out designs with users, give them a pen and have them modify the interface!

157
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:01,017
Or if they’ve got stuck or think something is weird,

158
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:05,021
grab a sheet of paper and make any modifications that you need.

159
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:11,005
You can bring paper prototyping tools into the boardroom, you can bring to clients —

160
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,060
any of the stakeholders that are involved in user interface design,

161
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,016
you can get them involved in paper prototyping.

162
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:18,068
That helps them get their ideas into the system

163
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:22,044
and empowers them to play a more active role in the design process.

164
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:28,042
Once you’re ready to move on from paper prototyping,  a useful next step can be to make a digital mockup.

165
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,028
Here’s an example of some mockups

166
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:35,093
that my research team made for a collaboration with anesthesiologists in the medical school at Stanford.

167
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,046
The first thing I’d like to point out about this

168
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:42,023
is that you can see that a lot more time went into this digital mockup

169
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:45,040
than into the paper prototypes that we’ve been talking about so far.

170
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,010
And that’s one of the reasons why I think paper prototyping is so important.

171
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,002
But there does come a time where you’ll want to get more specific about pixels,

172
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:56,080
and that’s when digital mockups can play an important role.

173
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,013
As your prototypes increase in fidelity — from storyboards, to paper prototypes, to digital mockups —

174
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:07,008
the kinds of evaluation and feedback that you’re going  to  get from people are going to evolve also.

175
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:10,043
So, early on, you might be talking about scenarios with people.

176
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,024
And then, with the paper prototype,

177
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:16,075
you might be running these informal “Try these out, here’s three alternatives” tests.

178
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:21,018
These prototypes can also be useful for critiques within your design team.

179
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:23,075
And as you get to higher and higher fidelity mockups,

180
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:28,046
you can have the opportunity to get to more formal experimentation techniques.

181
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:32,085
Rapid prototyping techniques are probably the most valuable weapon you’ll have

182
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,086
in a human-centred design process.

183
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:38,058
And if you’re interested in learning more, here are some resources that I recommend.

184
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,052
I’ll see you next time.
