1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:10,056
[sound] People are remarkable and all
sorts of ways, But an attention in short

2
00:00:10,056 --> 00:00:15,028
term memory are limited resources.
Fortunately, there's hope. The

3
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:20,043
representation provided by language,
gesture, drawings, and objects helps us

4
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:26,000
communicate and reason And importantly for
design, different representations can

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,071
facilitate or hinder different thoughts.
The inside of today's lecture is the ways

6
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:37,028
in which we and the world well organized
and represent ideas can have a drastic

7
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:42,065
impact on our cognitive abilities for
better and for worse. Things can help us

8
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:48,015
think and you can leverage this as a
designer. Let's start with an example that

9
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:53,086
comes from Don Norman and [inaudible].
It's a really strange diner and in this

10
00:00:53,086 --> 00:01:00,034
diner the wait staff is not so good And
three, the three people at the, at the

11
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:07,024
diner ordered oranges but they ended up on
the wrong plates and your job, you can try

12
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:13,072
this at home, is to help sort out which
orange belongs on which plate. And so, the

13
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:20,005
way that the, the orange puzzle works is
you need to order the oranges by size,

14
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:25,048
largest to smallest, left to right. Only
one orange can be transferred at a time,

15
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:30,042
and orange can only be transferred to a
plate on which it'll be in the largest And

16
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:35,036
only the largest orange on the plate can
be transferred to another plate and so on.

17
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:40,030
I have I have three oranges here. Our
recording got a little bit delayed because

18
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:45,054
somebody ate this little orange so I had
to go back to the market and get another

19
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:50,054
one But, but we have an orange now and let
me show you how this work. So, I'm gonna

20
00:01:50,054 --> 00:02:10,057
lay this out At my diner coffee. >> Here
you have the three oranges that, as

21
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:15,034
delivered by the wave staff and you can
see there in the wrong were the, the

22
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:20,061
largest ones in the middle and the middle
ones over here and the smallest one which

23
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:26,000
needs to be over here so over on this
side. And so to help save these diners one

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,077
of the TA's that you've seen in online
class, Alex is gonna come and, and sort

25
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:35,035
this out. >> Oh man, this is very
difficult. So I have to only transfer one

26
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:40,012
orange at a time, right? >> One orange at
a t ime. >> And it can only be to the

27
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:44,090
biggest plate. >> It, it has to be the
largest orange on the plate. >> Okay. So,

28
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,087
can I transfer this here? >> No, cuz then
it won't be the largest orange. >> Okay.

29
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:55,003
So, can I transfer it here? >> You got it.
>> Great And then kinda transfer this one

30
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:59,087
over here? >> Sure. >> And then this one
here. >> You got it. Well done. >> Thank

31
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:09,015
you And there's a couple other diners who
got similar orders, they all wanted bagels

32
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:17,047
and so. So, that the first course of
oranges, the second course is gonna be

33
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:24,036
bagels. The real bagel's puzzle is why you
can't get a decent bagel in California.

34
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:30,002
But the bagel puzzle that we have for
today is, is a little bit different. So,

35
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:35,062
we have our largest bagel, medium bagel,
smallest bagel. So, the plan is the same

36
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:40,084
except with the bagels, you have the
ability to stack them. You can out a

37
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:46,057
larger bagel on top of the smaller bagel
but not a smaller bagel on top of the

38
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:52,037
larger one. And so, at any point in time,
just like the oranges, it needs to be the

39
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:58,016
largest one on the plate and this is in
reverse order and Alex is gonna help us

40
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:04,025
again rearranging the bagels so that the
largest is on the left and the smallest is

41
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:10,047
on the right. >> Cool. So it has to be the
largest, right? >> Large is on the left.

42
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:16,027
>> So I can move this one here. >> You got
it. >> I can move this one here. >> Yup.

43
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:21,057
>> And I can move this one here. >> Yup.
There you go, well done. >> Now all of the

44
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:26,073
diners are happy assuming of course, its
New York bagels which they are not but

45
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:31,083
that's close enough for now. So, that's
our, that's our bagels came for today. You

46
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:37,005
can try these ate home and what you see is
that the fact that the bagels represent

47
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:41,095
some of the constraints of the problem. In
the physical structure, makes it much

48
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:47,002
easier to remember the state. You don't
have to remember which of these two bagels

49
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:52,003
is larger and therefore movable because
the larger on is on top, you're not gonna

50
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:57,011
move this medium sized bagel underneath
and that makes it all a lot easier when a,

51
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:01,099
when a representation of the problem in
forces th at constraints in the rule of

52
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:07,023
the problem And you can think of this a
lot of ways like when you leave your keys

53
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:12,038
by the door so that right as you walk out
the door, you bring your keys with you.

54
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:17,077
That's a, that's a way of structuring the
physical world to serve as a reminder that

55
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:23,018
to embed the constraint that you need to
leave with your keys in the physical space

56
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:27,089
itself And some of you may have realize
that you can think of these being Towers

57
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:32,033
of Hanoi and what's interesting thing
about this Towers of Hanoi is the kids

58
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:37,023
came where you can move circles between
pegs that look a lot like bagels. And what

59
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:41,095
we've done is we've turned this Towers of
Hanoi game into something where the, the

60
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:46,022
rules are the same. It's just the
representations changed and, and let's

61
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:51,025
play a game. We're gonna, we're gonna play
card games now. Two players, each of you

62
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:57,063
is gonna draw a number, one at a time such
that you have three numbers that add up to

63
00:05:57,063 --> 00:06:03,012
fifteen. And your draw is without
replacement. So, if I pick five, that's no

64
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:10,049
longer available. For example, if I was
able to get four, five, and six together,

65
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:19,044
that add up to fifteen and that would be a
winning hand And let's say for example, I

66
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:31,031
picked five for starters and the other
player picks six so I pick three. And the

67
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:41,006
other player picks two And then I picked
seven. That would be a, a winning hand

68
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:47,018
And, this is hard enough for one pair. As
you can see, it's even harder to try and

69
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:53,053
play both sides. So we can make this a
little bit easier. So let's say instead of

70
00:06:53,053 --> 00:07:00,045
having a b. Numbers imaginary in our head
will do the same thing but with playing

71
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:07,011
cards and so, I'm gonna be able to have
the number Ace, three, nine here or Ace,

72
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:12,094
three, nine. So, here we have a playing
cards Ace, two, nine. And again two

73
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:20,010
players and this time we can land in the
table so, so maybe so I can see him And

74
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:27,038
again start up by picking five And the
other player might pick six and so I'll go

75
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:33,088
three and at this point, especially if
other player can see my numbers and don't

76
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:40,080
know that seven is what I want next so
they're gonna go seven An d I'll go two to

77
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,079
prevent their fifteen and alright, now we
got a head off in another [inaudible]. So

78
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:57,008
and you can do And let's try, one, I
haven't thought it through but that, but

79
00:07:57,008 --> 00:08:03,043
that might that might help and at this
point, I start to wonder whether, whether

80
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:08,086
this is gonna works. So, take, I'm not
really playing here but I'll take

81
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:17,096
Twelve:14 almost and, and it's kind of
nothing you can do at this point so no

82
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:28,002
dice A lot easier especially early on but
still somewhat challenging. Let's play

83
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:35,077
another game. We'll, we'll pick an easier
this time. How about Tic Tac Toe? So, this

84
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:44,001
is pretty easy. I think many of you know
this game so we can do x's in those. So we

85
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:53,073
can go x ad somebody can go o. We can do x
and o and x and o and x wins. That game is

86
00:08:53,073 --> 00:09:00,016
a whole lot faster than either of the two
cards we play but what might shock you is

87
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:06,022
that these two games are [inaudible]. So,
I can fill in the numbers one, two, nine

88
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:22,083
and have them be exactly equivalent to our
card game. [sound] Any row or diagonal

89
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:28,021
that adds to fifteen also produces a
winning game in Tic Tac Toe. So for

90
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:33,059
example, I can pick this right column,
that's fifteen, fifteen all the way

91
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:39,048
through. And what we see from this is that
the way that you represent the problem

92
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:45,042
drawing numbers in our head, cards on the
table or numbers on the grid has drastic

93
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:51,008
influences on our ability to solve that
problem fluently and to see alternate

94
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:56,092
solutions and to be able to coordinate our
action with another person. And this is

95
00:09:56,092 --> 00:10:01,052
why Herb Simon, the famous artificial
intelligence and cognitive science

96
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:06,088
researcher writes that solving a problem
simply means representing it so as to make

97
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:11,086
the solution transparent. For example if
you think about proofs in mathematics,

98
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:18,006
what's true at the end of the proofs is
also true at the beginning. The only thing

99
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:25,014
that's changed along the way is that the
Fact that the proof is indeed true has

100
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:32,052
been rendered clear to the reader. Why
were the oranges puzzle and the number

101
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:39,079
selection game so difficult? It's because
both of [inaudible] are working memory. We

102
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:45,024
have to keep in mi nd what moves are
possible, what numbers we held, what the

103
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:51,001
other person was thinking and maybe doing.
And that was a lot to keep in mind all at

104
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:56,046
once. Human beings are incredible in all
sorts of ways. Working memory is not one

105
00:10:56,046 --> 00:11:02,057
of them. And one of the most important
things that we can do with user interfaces

106
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:08,053
by embedding the constraints of the
problem in the user interface itself is to

107
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:14,034
off load working memory so that those
limited resources become available for

108
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:20,000
other people. You may have heard the
famous a seven+ or -two as a limit of

109
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,026
working memory that we can keep seven+ or
-two things available at any point in time

110
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:34,083
And If not exactly true the real story is
a bit more complicated but if you wanna

111
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:41,042
have a rule of thumb to work with as a
designer, I suggest that two plus or minus

112
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:47,068
two that basically don't require users to
keep anything in mind that you can

113
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:54,005
possibly put on the screen. So far the
examples that we've looked at oranges,

114
00:11:54,005 --> 00:12:00,036
bagels, cards, Tic Tac Toe are kind of toy
problems and you know they may make for

115
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:09,031
some good entertainment at a dinner party
but it's not real world stuff. They

116
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:14,054
demonstrate however principles of the
power of distributing cognition. That

117
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:19,021
absolutely has a real world impact. One
great example of this is the Task

118
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:24,023
Management System getting things done. Is
very much designed in the principles of

119
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:29,002
distributing cognition and mind. So, for
example, one of the rules of the getting

120
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:33,082
things done system is that whenever
something comes to your mind that you need

121
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:38,067
to do, the first thing you do is write it
down somewhere, anywhere and the reason

122
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:43,084
for that is if you have something in mind
that needs to be completed and you haven't

123
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:48,082
written it down yet, you're spending a lot
of cycles of working memory remembering.

124
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:53,058
To, I need to do my laundry to see if I
need to do my laundry. I need to do my

125
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:58,053
laundry and that's chewing up resources
that could be better deployed elsewhere.

126
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:04,083
Write it down if it gets out of your mind
and you can move on. One of the words that

127
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:11,068
people toss around all the time in terms
of effective user interfaces is that this

128
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:18,003
user interface is natural. And when we say
that, we mean a couple of different

129
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:23,075
things. But one of the things that we
mean, we can see in our example in our

130
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:29,028
oranges and bagels that the bagels as a
task is more natural because the

131
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:35,049
properties of the representation bagels
can stack matches the properties of, of

132
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:44,002
the thing that's being represented. One of
my user interfaces for this perspective is

133
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:51,080
the protease indigestible pill. This is a
pill that when you swallow it, it sends

134
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:59,066
out a little signal so that your, your
phone or the Internet knows that you've

135
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:06,007
taken this pill And, the, The ability of
keeping track of whether you have taken

136
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:12,041
the pill or not automatically by virtue of
taking the pill is a really natural user

137
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:18,068
interface that the ingestion act serves
both to take the pill and to mark that you

138
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:24,065
have done so. There's another example of a
really natural interaction in, in the

139
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:31,007
system which is that in addition to pill,
there's a, a transmitter that you need to

140
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:38,021
stick to your body And the transmitter has
a limited battery life. So, how do you

141
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:44,010
turn the transmitter on? It's a band aid
like system and the way that you turn on

142
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:50,005
the transmitter is you heal back the band
aid bandage and that turns it on And so

143
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:56,001
again, that action that you need to do to
stick it on yourself is exactly the same

144
00:14:56,001 --> 00:15:01,090
action that you use to turn the peel on
And so by integrating the necessary step

145
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:08,079
with the step that's easy to forget. You
don't forget the step anymore. So let's

146
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:15,015
bring this back to normally user
interfaces. Here's an example of the print

147
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:20,050
dialog on a Macintosh And one of the
things that you can see here is that

148
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:26,000
there's a world in miniature strategy in
this print dialog box. So, if I wanna look

149
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,076
at the Stanford Academic Calendar I can, I
can print that here. And, what we're gonna

150
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:37,025
look at is, here's our world in miniature
where we see the entire legal sized page

151
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:42,088
shown inside the dialog box and one of the
things that, that makes clear is that I'm

152
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:48,017
not gonna be able to fit the top and the
bottom of the page. On a, on a letter

153
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:54,015
sized page because a letter sized page is,
is three inches shorter than the large

154
00:15:54,015 --> 00:16:00,004
page and so consequently You know, it's
probably not something I wanna do And, one

155
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:05,002
of the things that I like about this is
that by showing you the world in

156
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:10,055
miniature, the challenges of working that
you've gotta decide here become much

157
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:17,067
clearer. Here's another example. This is
from Microsoft Word and what we can see

158
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:25,015
here is I'm again about to print this and
the dialog box that I get from word says a

159
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:32,028
foot of section one is set outside the
printable area of the page, do you want to

160
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:38,061
continue? And I can click Yes or I can
click no. Now, in order to answer this

161
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:44,091
problem, I need to know is it just that
the bounding box of the footer is outside

162
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:51,005
what the printer can print and so it's
irrelevant or is there actually content

163
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:56,038
that I need that won't be printed. None of
that is available from this dialog box And

164
00:16:56,038 --> 00:17:00,059
so unlike the previous print dialog box
where we saw the world in miniature and

165
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,081
could see what was being cut off, here we
have no idea what, what's being cut off

166
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:10,007
And consequently, this is a much less
effect user interface And that's the end

167
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,014
of Part one.
