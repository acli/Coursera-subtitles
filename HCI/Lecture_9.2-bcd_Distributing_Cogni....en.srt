1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:07,058
We've all heard the saying that a picture
is worth ten thousand words. This idea of

2
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:13,008
worth is interesting because it implies
some kind of interchangeability. There are

3
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:17,058
some rate at which you can convert one
representation into another

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:25,042
representation. How might we establish
that interchangeability. One type of

5
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:29,049
interchange ability is informational
equipment. Two representations are

6
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:34,002
informationally equivalent if all the
information is present in one, can also be

7
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:39,091
inferred from the other But just because
the same information is theoretically

8
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:46,058
inferable doesn't mean it will take the
same required effort to extract it. Some

9
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:51,072
representations require more steps to
computing inference. And the difference in

10
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:56,081
the perceivers computational effort
presents both challenges and opportunities

11
00:00:56,081 --> 00:01:02,042
for you as a designer. Let's look at an
example. Eight percent a pair of parallel

12
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:10,019
lines is cut by a transversal. This cut
generates eight angles. From the sentence,

13
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,064
it's difficult to reason about which pairs
form the alternate interior angles. And in

14
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:20,076
fact if you to try, you'll find yourself
creating a mental image of two parallel

15
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:27,019
lines cut by a transversal. With the
diagram like this however, the sentence in

16
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:32,068
the diagram are informationally equivalent
but computationally different for the

17
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:37,070
perceiver. One major benefit of the
graphical user interface over the command

18
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,030
line is that the graphical user interface
enables many common actions to be

19
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,018
perception tasks requiring little
inference. So far we've seen a number of

20
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:53,021
examples of how distributed cognition can
help individual work. Distributing how

21
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:58,004
ignition can also have powerful benefits
for group report and just to give you a,

22
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:02,057
a, a quick sense of what this might be
like. I'll give you an example from Ed

23
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:07,070
Hushon's research on airplane cockpits.
One of the things that observed is that

24
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,081
the artifacts in the cockpit help
coordinate action between the multiple

25
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:18,047
people that work there, the pilots. And so
for example, one, one instance of this is

26
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:24,013
the is the speed dial Where our landing
and takeoff. It's incre dibly important to

27
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:29,008
have the speed, be accurate because you
are at the most critical part of the, the

28
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:33,079
airplane. Your close to the ground, the
wings are designed for [inaudible]

29
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:39,012
designed primarily for going long and very
high and the shape of the wings have to be

30
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:44,019
changed to accommodate the lowest speed
that is required for landing and takeoff

31
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,028
and so, the multiple pilots on the large
airplane need to coordinate their efforts

32
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:54,030
and in several important ways. There are
several plastic indicators called bugs.

33
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,013
Around the perimeter of this speedometer
and the pilots can manually set those bugs

34
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:06,018
to do things like mark where a speed what
events will cause a change in the, certain

35
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:11,075
cause of change in the wing settings and
other things like that and what's nice

36
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:17,066
about these bugs is that they are visible
not just to the pilot that set them but to

37
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:23,065
everybody else in the cockpit also And so,
by remembering the by Making it triggers

38
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:29,036
for what will caused changes in action
manifest to everybody. These artifacts can

39
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:40,077
help coordinate collaboration and increase
safety in cockpit situations. So, what was

40
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:44,085
seen here is that when interface is
helping people distribute cognition, it

41
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:49,026
can encourage experimentation like we saw
in Tetris. It can scuttled learning and

42
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:53,046
reduce air, it's like we saw with the
[inaudible] blocks. It can show only the

43
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:57,043
differences that matter like in the
[inaudible] on the ground map. It can

44
00:03:57,043 --> 00:04:01,040
convert slow calculation in the fast
perception like we saw with the map

45
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,087
coloring. It can support trunking
especially by experts as we saw with the

46
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:10,060
chess and with gesture interfaces. It can
increase efficiency as we saw with

47
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,058
diagrammatic representations and it can
facilitate collaboration like we saw in

48
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:20,019
the cockpit. Given all of these benefits
of good representations, it's kinda

49
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,086
surprising that a whole lot of actual
interfaces that are out there offer a

50
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:29,089
really crummy job at being able to help
people distribute their cognitive efforts.

51
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:34,067
So I call these four representations
common but deadly. Let's take a look at a

52
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:39,069
couple of them. Here's one. I was at a
symposium at IBM a couple of years ago. To

53
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:44,035
get on their Wi-Fi network, I needed to
enter a password. And, I typed in a

54
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:49,079
password that I thought would be just fine
and the Wi-Fi system told me, the password

55
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:55,036
you typed is not valid. Please change.
What do I need to change it to? The, all

56
00:04:55,036 --> 00:05:00,061
passwords often have different
requirements like mixtures of upper and

57
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:06,090
lower case letters. The absence of numbers
or special modifier keys and, there's no

58
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,060
way for me to know from the screen what
the problem with the password that I

59
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,021
entered was. This representation would
obviously be a heck of a lot better if,

60
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:21,062
when I entered the password, it said, you
need a password that is at least ten

61
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:26,020
characters long and they contain the
mixture of upper and lower case characters

62
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,090
or that has at least one number. And that
could be validated the first time that I

63
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,054
check in the new password as supposed
[inaudible] till I type in both and hit Go

64
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:40,080
and it says, uh-uh. Here's another
example, NASA invited me to give a talk in

65
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,020
an event they had in San Francisco a year
or so ago and the registration for this

66
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,013
event was, this, this is the web form from
it and I, I thought I registered. I

67
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:56,072
clicked Go and after hitting Next, it said
you must fill out all registered fields.

68
00:05:56,072 --> 00:06:02,044
You can see that at the top of the screen
right here and totally frustrating if you

69
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:07,098
try and register because you [inaudible]
well. Which one did I miss? It would be a

70
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:13,072
lot more effective if for example you
could highlight the things that you it

71
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:19,060
thinks you need to fill out or it could
create a smaller form that has only parts

72
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,049
that you missed the last time around and
says here is the one thing you needed to

73
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:31,079
fill that out before continuing. Here's
another example. This, this from BBEdit

74
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:37,081
and it when I tried to save it says,
document encoding mismatched. The document

75
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:44,005
contains data which describes its encoding
as UTFA. But the encoding has been set to

76
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:49,084
western, I saw Latin one and I have two
options here. One of them is cancel and

77
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:55,033
another one is save anyway. But the
actions that I'd lik e to be able to do

78
00:06:55,033 --> 00:07:04,079
are probably something like. Make
everything UTF8 or make everything at one

79
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,047
or. A computer tell me which of these is
probably makes more sense, help me choose

80
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:15,095
between these or it doesn't matter but the
information that I need to be able to make

81
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:20,092
a decision simply isn't present in the
user interface, dialog box is should be

82
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:26,015
action oriented. They should help guide
towards users towards what their next step

83
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:31,025
is likely to be and you should provide
them with the information that they need

84
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:36,045
in order to be able to accomplish that
next step. Here's an interface that I

85
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:42,043
think is intentionally design to be
sub-optimal. Here we have the eBay funding

86
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:49,040
confirmation page and If you look at this
page, what you'll see is if you I switched

87
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,003
to a credit card and it says, before you
go to credit card we're gonna give you

88
00:07:55,003 --> 00:08:00,053
this, this prompt that, that ask you to
verify that and, and eBay and PayPal do

89
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:06,016
this of course because they make use more
money if you see the bank account as

90
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:11,084
supposed you pay through credit card
transaction fee. And so down at the bottom

91
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:18,005
here it offers you two buttons. One of
them is pay with bank account and the

92
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:25,066
other one was pad with credit card. Good
action are in the titles, I really like

93
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:32,047
that part of this user interface. And what
you see is that the account that they want

94
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:38,017
you to pick is, is made nice and bright
and the account that you probably want is

95
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:43,033
dimmed out as if it's inactive. Is this is
a good user interface or bad user

96
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:48,006
interface? Well, user-experience is
probably somewhat degraded. Paypal's

97
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:53,031
profit significant increases and in a lot
of real world situations, you need them,

98
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:58,056
you may need to make this trade off. I, I
think that more globally there are other

99
00:08:58,056 --> 00:09:03,087
ways that you could address this but I
thought this was an interesting example of

100
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:09,026
the interaction design that sacrificed
some user experience in order to achieve

101
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:13,099
higher profits. Hard to say whether it's
worth it. Here's a dialog box for

102
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:19,013
exporting a picture. We want to save that
to JPEG and the dialog box is notifying us

103
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:24,017
that this JPEG al ready exist. And you got
a couple of options so one thing that like

104
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:29,028
about thing that I like about this future
interface is that you get buttons that are

105
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:34,039
really action oriented here, that's great.
A challenge is, how do I know whether I

106
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,047
want this file or not? I mean, what is
l1010235.jpg. It would make a lot more

107
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:45,051
sense if this dialog box showed me an icon
of here's what here's what this picture is

108
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:51,020
and that way I could have a better sense
of whether I wanted to override it or skip

109
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,080
this operation or give it a brand new
unique name. Here's an example from

110
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,051
Microsoft Outlook. This is a duplicate
contact detected dialog box and it says

111
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:08,029
that he, you know the there's some
information here that already exist in

112
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:14,044
your contact. Do you wanna update it or do
you want to add this as a new contact. The

113
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:20,008
difficulty of course is, I don't know
what's in that contact right now and so

114
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:25,086
this is not a decision that I can make
from looking at this dialog box on its

115
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:31,037
own. I can of course click open existing
contact to show me that information but

116
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:36,063
that's one extra step down the line.
Microsoft improves this in a subsequent

117
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:41,062
version of Outlook. This dialog box is
probably still more complicated that it

118
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:46,080
really needs to be. I think it could be
streamline significantly but what it does

119
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,078
do is it shows me the two things that I
really need to know. The first of this

120
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:56,096
what the final outcome of the process is
gonna look like. So after we merge these

121
00:10:56,096 --> 00:11:02,014
things, here's what you'll get. And the
other thing it's gonna show me is here the

122
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:07,091
piece of information that we're gonna
change in order to make that happen. One

123
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:13,087
way that I think this dialog box could be
stream line is that, well it shows that

124
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:19,076
the new, the final [inaudible] information
this way and it gives us the, so I can

125
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:25,005
change this or happening here. The old
contact information is shown in a

126
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:30,068
completely different format and so it's
difficult to compare. If you believe that

127
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:35,018
you don't need to see that information
because the relevance that certain here,

128
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:39,085
well then, just don't include this. If on
the other h and you decide that we do need

129
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:44,052
to show the old version because you may
wanna keep it, you know in that case it

130
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:49,002
probably make it a lot more sense to show
it in the manner that's parallel with

131
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:54,068
these other two boxes. What we've covered
in this past two lectures is understanding

132
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:59,060
of the theoretical foundations of how the
representation of information And have

133
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,068
tremendous consequences in terms of the
user experience of the system. I think

134
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:10,008
this is one of the most interesting topics
in all of ACI. And if you find this area

135
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:15,016
as interesting as I did, there is a couple
of books that I can recommend to go

136
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:20,024
further here. One of them is Herb Simons,
the science of the artificial. It is a

137
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:25,078
great monograph written several decades
now about the Role of design and science

138
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:31,010
and about the nature of mental
representations really interesting book.

139
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:37,009
Another one here is Ed Hutchins' book,
Cognition in the Wild which lays out a

140
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:43,039
foundation for distributed cognition. And
describes as work in airplanes and then

141
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:49,061
and on naval ships. [sound]. And the last
we have here is Don Norman's book, Things

142
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:55,045
That Makes Us Smart. Which is a, a great
book about a lot of cognitive science

143
00:12:55,045 --> 00:13:01,015
research and distributive cognition and
the roles of representation in cognition

144
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:06,077
and this is one of the sources of, of
several of the examples in this lecture

145
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:10,086
like as what these other books too. I'll
see you next time.
