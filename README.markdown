This is a collection of all the subtitles I have done or QA’d
for the Coursera classes I have taken.  For some of my thoughts
on this whole exercise (of transcribing lectures), please head

Things to watch out for if you want to work on Coursera’s subtitles:
===================================================================

These are not obvious, and I found them out the hard way, If you
haven’t started yet, then it’d be better to know them before you
start.

1. A program called stanford-bot will attempt to automatically
   generate a transcript, presumably with speech recognition
   technology. This transcript is always generated.

2. A corollary of the above is that if there are no subtitles
   when you start working, and still no subtitles when you
   finish, then be prepared that stanford-bot will overwrite
   your work. When this happens just revert back to your version,
   but only if your version is complete, i.e., only if it covers
   100% of the video.

3. However, if stanford-bot’s transcript is already present before
   you start, then depending on how perfectionist you are, you
   might want to just throw away its transcript, or at least
   reformat it before using. The transcript that it generates have
   very strange formatting that is very hard to work with, and the
   subtitles are cut off at very illogical places which require
   a lot of work to fix. It can get so bad that it takes as long
   to try to fix it as to throw it away and start over.

4. Do not use Universal Subtitles’ “upload transcript” function.
   Ever. That function is buggy and will screw up the revision
   history.  This is especially important if there are already
   subtitles in other languages; if you use “upload transcript”
   you will regret it.

5. The accuracy of the English transcript is paramount. It is
   in fact extremely important to get it right, because it will
   be used as the basis for non-English subtitles.

Note: A couple of scripts to faciliate step 3 can be found in
the scripts directory of this repo.
