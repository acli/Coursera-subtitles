00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,011
Hi... Remember we were talking about
problem solving. We talked about, when you

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:08,001
first solve a problem, what you do is come
up with a perspective, a way of

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:12,034
representing the set of solutions. Then we
talked about how you use heuristics to

4
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:16,056
search among those possible solutions,
given your representation. And we've seen

5
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:21,005
how having lots of heuristics and diverse
heuristics can help you find, look at more

6
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:24,090
points, and find, possibly find better
solutions. What we wanna do in this

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,096
lecture, is combine those two ideas,
perspectives plus heuristics, to show why

8
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:33,010
teams of people. Can often find solutions
to problems that individuals can't. That

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,015
why teams are better. Now I say teams, I'm
gonna use this in a very loose sense. I

10
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:41,025
don't necessarily mean, a team of people
sitting in a room and brainstorming. That

11
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:44,079
sort of stuff. What I mean is, a
collection of people, possibly you know,

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,059
working even over time. So even if it's
something like your toaster on your

13
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,068
counter, you can think of that as being
something that's been really consistently

14
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:56,078
and constantly improved upon by a team of
people. So there's the person who first

15
00:00:56,078 --> 00:01:00,053
invented the toaster. Then somebody
improved it. Then somebody come up with

16
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:04,084
the crumb tray. Then somebody came up with
the automatic shut off. And all sorts of

17
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:09,064
things, right? So a toaster consists of a
whole bunch of improvements. And you can

18
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:14,014
think of that as being. That current
solution we have is being something that

19
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:18,078
the team has come up with. So again, by
team I don't necessarily mean a group all

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:23,030
working together and in some unit. You
just need a collection of people. So how

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,096
does it work? Why are teams and why are
groups of people better than individuals?

22
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:32,073
Well, let's go back and let's think about
the, the candy bar example. Remember I had

23
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:37,032
one landscape, one perspective based on
calories, and that had three local peaks,

24
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:41,049
right? And, well, let's represent those by
A, B and C. And then I had another

25
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,057
landscape that was represented by
masticity, and that had five peaks. And we

26
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:49,081
can call these, let's call these A, B, D,
E and F. So, these are different than the

27
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:54,005
peaks for the caloric landscape. With the
one exception. Notice for sure that A,

28
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:58,068
which is the best possible point, that has
to be a point in the caloric landscape and

29
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:03,009
it's also gotta be a peak in the masticity
landscape. And that's because it's the

30
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:07,028
best possible point. So it's the best
possible point, it's gotta be a point in

31
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:11,061
every landscape. Now we can characterize
these problem solvers. By their local

32
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:16,096
peaks, by their local optimum. So, the
local optimum of the caloric landscape are

33
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:21,097
A, B, and C. The local optimum for the
domesticity landscape are A, B, D, and F.

34
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:26,041
And we remember we said that the caloric
landscape was a better landscape than the

35
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:30,079
masticity landscape. Because of the fact
that it had fewer local optima. So one way

36
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:35,012
to figure out how good you are at solving
a problem is how many local optima you

37
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:39,007
have given your perspective and your
heuristic. Now here was something the

38
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:43,029
heuristic, right? Is just hill climbing.
Let's go deeper. Cuz that's just a, that's

39
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:47,067
a fairly crude way of thinking about how
good a problem solver is. We can actually

40
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:52,019
take into account, the average value of
those peaks. So the piece where people get

41
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,052
stuck are A, B, C, D, E, and F. And we can
assign a value to each of those. So

42
00:02:56,052 --> 00:03:01,044
suppose the value of A is ten, B is eight,
and so on. So A is the out local op, the A

43
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:06,018
is the global optimum, and some of these
other peaks aren't so good. Well we can

44
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:11,010
usually can ask, what's the average value
of a peak for the caloric problem solver?

45
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,084
So the problem solver who thinks in terms
of the caloric perspective, then gets

46
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:20,052
stuck at A, B, and C. What's the average
value? Well, A has a value of ten. B has a

47
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:25,066
value of eight. C has a value of six. And
so, we're gonna give the abilities as the

48
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:30,046
average of those three peaks, which is
eight. But if I look at the masticity

49
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:35,034
problem solver, they get stuck at, at A,
B, D, E, and F. And those have values ten,

50
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:40,015
eight, six, two, and four. And the average
of those is six. So when you think about

51
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:44,078
the ability of the masticity problem
solver as being six. So not only did it

52
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:49,089
correct problems of our local optima. They
had higher average values. This is another

53
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:54,077
reason why that person's a better problem
solver. Let's think of them now, though,

54
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:59,018
as working as a team. I think, in the
working as a team, the caloric problem

55
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:03,067
solver gets stuck at A, B, and C, the
domesticity problem solver gets stuck at

56
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:08,023
A, B, D, E, and F. Let's suppose, first,
[inaudible] problem solver works on the

57
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:12,077
problem first, and she gets stuck at B.
She then passes the problem to the

58
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:17,031
[inaudible] problem solver. And the
[inaudible] person says, well, you know

59
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:22,005
what? I can't help you, because B looks
pretty good to me. Because B is also a

60
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:27,004
peak for him. Suppose instead, though,
that the caloric problem solver gets stuck

61
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:32,011
at C. And she passes C on to the masticity
problem solver. And now this masticity

62
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:36,086
person, C, if you notice, isn't anywhere
in this list. C is [inaudible] optima.

63
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:42,012
That means that the masticity person can
get from C to some other local optima. And

64
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:46,086
it's gotta be one that's better. Why does
it have to be better? Because she's, this

65
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:51,017
person's hill climbing, if he's hill
climbing, then he's got to be able to find

66
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:55,032
something that's better than C and that's
going to be either A or B. So the

67
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:59,086
intersection of these local optima A and B
are the only places where they can get

68
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:04,024
stuck. If, for example, the [inaudible]
person went first and got stuck at E, then

69
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:08,056
the [inaudible] person could take E and
get to someplace else, either A, B or C.

70
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:13,058
If she gets to A or B the masticity person
is also stuck. If she gets to C, then the

71
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:18,061
masticity person can then in turn take it
up to A or B so the only places that the

72
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:23,033
team can get stuck is A or B. If you make
this form up called the intersection

73
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:27,099
property that the local optima for the
team is the intersection of the local

74
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:32,073
optima for the individuals. So, if we look
at the team, there's only two places the

75
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:36,087
team can get stuck, ten and A, and the
average value there is nine. So, the

76
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:41,044
ability of the team is higher than the
ability. Of either person. And the reason

77
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:46,027
why is because the team's local optima is
the intersection of the local optima for

78
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:50,093
the individuals. So the reason why, then,
we see over time products get better, the

79
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:55,053
reason why we see teams being really
innovative, the reason why we see a lot of

80
00:05:55,053 --> 00:06:00,012
science being done by teams of people is
because the only place a team can get

81
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:04,032
stuck is where everybody on the team can
get stuck. So this very simple model,

82
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:08,015
having perspectives and heuristics, can
explain, why is it the case that teams are

83
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:11,079
so much better than individuals? And why,
over time, we keep finding better and

84
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,043
better solutions to problems. It's not
necessarily that we're getting smarter.

85
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:19,017
Now, it's true, we are coming up with new
ways to represent problems. And we also

86
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:22,081
are coming up with all sorts of new
heuristics all the time. We're developing

87
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:26,045
new ways to solve problems all the time.
But another thing that's going on, is,

88
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:29,090
just because of the accumulation of so
many different ways of looking at

89
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,049
problems, and so many different ways of
trying to solve them, that we get the

90
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:38,097
intersection. Of all those peaks and that
gives us better solutions. So here's the

91
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:43,080
big claim. The team can only get stuck at
a solution that's a local optima for

92
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,093
everyone on the team. That means the team
has to be better than the people in it. So

93
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:54,001
what we want, right, you want people with
different local optima. You want people to

94
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:59,003
get stuck in different places. Well how do
we get it? We don't. We've already looked

95
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:03,059
at this twice, right? We looked at it
first perspective perspectives. So if you

96
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:08,050
coat it this way and I coat it this way,
then we're going to get stuck in different

97
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,017
places. We also want people with different
heuristics. If I look in this direction

98
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:17,077
and this direction, and you look in this
direction and this direction, and we add

99
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:22,032
us together, we look in all four of those
directions. So what we want, is we want

100
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:26,098
diverse perspectives, and we want diverse
heuristics. And that diversity will give

101
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:31,041
us different local optima, and those
different local optima will mean that we

102
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:35,095
take the intersections, and we end up with
better points. That's sort of the big

103
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:40,038
idea. So if we take, again, let's play
this out in more deals. And imagine we've

104
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,040
got these, just, here's this set of
solutions. If one of us looks like this.

105
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,059
And one of us looks maybe two to the left.
And one looks two down. And one looks to

106
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:52,032
the north, south, east and west. If we
have all of these different, you know,

107
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:56,056
maybe one person looks two over this way,
all these different heuristics looking at

108
00:07:56,056 --> 00:08:00,055
the problem that means we're less likely
to get stuck at the same point. Which

109
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:04,064
means the team is going to do better. Or,
over time, society is going to do better

110
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:09,043
finding solutions to problems. This all
seems really smooth and nice and great and

111
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:14,039
we've seen, teams are better, we see the
value of diverse perspective, we see the

112
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,028
value of diverse heuristics. But what's
missing? Cuz this seems highly stylized.

113
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:24,017
There's two things that I've left out.
First one is [sound] right, we can write

114
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:28,010
this down as communication. I've assumed
that when you've got a team solving a

115
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,062
problem that they can communicate their
solutions to one another right away. Now

116
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:35,031
that's not always the case. There's a lot
of misunderstandings going on and we might

117
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:38,069
not listen. I might just say, no I'm not
listening. I'm not listening, right? And

118
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:42,046
no matter what you say we don't find a
better solution. And think of something

119
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:47,010
like the toaster though, it's weird, we
can communicate through the toaster. If I

120
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,086
come up with a better toaster and I make
it, then you can look at my solution and

121
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:56,062
know what I've done and then you can add
the crumb tray. So think about making an

122
00:08:56,062 --> 00:09:00,062
artifact, the artifact itself, the
artifact is the solution. That gets

123
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:05,020
communicated right away, but generally
speaking communication can be a problem.

124
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,058
The other thing I've assumed is that.
There is the possibilities that an error.

125
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:15,019
In interpreting the value of a solution.
So, I'm assuming if somebody proposes a

126
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:19,071
solution and its better, we instantly know
it. It's as if there's some sort of oracle

127
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:23,026
we can go to and say, oh yip, that's a
better solution. That may not always be

128
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:27,000
the case. So it could be that I could do
something really interesting and people

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,079
just think no, it's a bad idea. They make
an error in terms of whether or not its

130
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,062
interesting thing or it could be that I
propose something that's worse, and people

131
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:38,050
think oh that's a great idea and then we
actually look and it's not a good idea. So

132
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,096
I've assumed there no errors in
determining the value of the solution, and

133
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:45,075
when somebody proposes this solution, you
know exactly what it's worth. That's not

134
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:49,040
always going to be the case. So it's won't
always be true that there's perfect

135
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,058
communication in this perfect evaluation.
So, in a Ricksher model, we could include

136
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:58,011
communication error. And that's going to
hurt teams. And we can also include just

137
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:02,036
errant evaluation. That's also going to
hurt teams. Even so, right, this power,

138
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:06,043
this model has shown us something fairly
powerful, which is that diverse

139
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:11,002
representations of problems in diverse
ways of coming up with solutions can make

140
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:15,055
teams of people better able at coming up
with solutions than individuals. And it

141
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:20,008
also sort of told us where innovation is
coming from, right? Innovation is coming

142
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:24,055
from different ways of seeing problems,
and different ways of finding solutions.

143
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:28,026
There's a lot going on, right? And now,
I've got this model of problem solving,

144
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:32,017
and when you think about people finding
solutions to particular problems. Now we

145
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:35,097
want to step back a bit in the next
lecture when I think about, what about

146
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:39,072
bigger things like designing a house,
designing a car, designing a railway

147
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:43,052
system, designing a city, the bigger
problems. Well, often times those bigger

148
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:47,063
problems, the solutions, you would think
of a, like making a computer. The computer

149
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,084
may consist of the solutions to a whole
bunch of sub-problems. So where we want to

150
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:55,089
go next is you want to talk about how we
combine solutions to come up with new

151
00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:00,015
solutions. And we'll see how that can even
be used as an argument to where economic,

152
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:04,011
where economic growth comes from. It
actually comes from individual solutions

153
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,060
being recombined. Okay, thanks.
