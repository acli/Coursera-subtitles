00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,072
Hi. In this lecture we’re talking about problem solving.

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:09,057
And we’re talking about the role that diverse perspectives play in finding solutions to problems.

3
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:10,056
So when you think about a problem,

4
00:00:10,056 --> 00:00:12,068
perspective is how you represent it.

5
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:16,092
So remember from the previous lecture, we talked about landscapes.

6
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:19,036
We talked about landscape being able to represent

7
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,087
the solutions along this axis

8
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:27,020
and the value of the solutions as the height.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,090
And so this is metaphorically a way to represent

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,072
how someone might think about solving a problem—

11
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:36,075
finding high points on their landscape.

12
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:40,064
What we want to do is take this metaphor and formalize it

13
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:44,014
and part of the reason for this course is to get better logic,

14
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:45,070
I can be able to think through things in a clear way.

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,072
So I’m going to take this landscape metaphor and turn it into a formal model.

16
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:50,079
So how do we do it?

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,077
The first thing we do is we formally define what a perspective is.

18
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:56,098
So we speak math to metaphor.

19
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,002
So what a perspective is going to be is

20
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:01,097
it’s going to be a representation of all possible solutions.

21
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:05,038
So it’s some encoding of the set of possible solutions to the problem.

22
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:08,086
Once we have that encoding of the set of possible solutions,

23
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:13,062
then we can create our landscape by just assigning a value to each one of those solutions.

24
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:16,035
And that will give us a landscape picture like you saw before.

25
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,080
Now most of us are familiar with perspectives,

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,040
even though we don’t know it.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,056
Let me give some examples.

28
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,053
Remember when we took seventh grade math?

29
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:27,067
We learned about how to represent a point, how to plot points.

30
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,088
And we typically learned two ways to do it.

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,054
The first way was Cartesian coordinates.

32
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:35,003
So given a point, we would represent it

33
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:38,075
by and an X and a Y value in space.

34
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,037
So, it might be five units,

35
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:42,037
this would be the point, let’s say (5, 2).

36
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:45,089
It’s five units in the X direction, two units in the Y direction.

37
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:48,071
But we also learned another way to represent points,

38
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:50,070
and that was [polar] coordinates.

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,043
So we can take the same point and say,

40
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,093
there’s a radius, which is its distance from the origin,

41
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:56,065
and then there’s some angle theta,

42
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,049
which says how far we have to sweep out,

43
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,071
in order to sweep that radius out in order to get to the point.

44
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,058
So two totally reasonable ways to represent a point:

45
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,065
X and Y, R and theta.

46
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:09,068
Cartesian, polar.

47
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,036
Which is better?

48
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:13,015
Well, the answer? It depends.

49
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,008
Let me show you why.

50
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,037
Suppose I wanted to describe this line,

51
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:19,088
in order to describe this line I should use Cartesian coordinates.

52
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:23,063
I can just say Y=3 and X moves from two to five.

53
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:25,006
It’s really easy.

54
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:28,063
But suppose I wanna describe this arc.

55
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,096
If I wanna describe this arc,

56
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:32,072
now Cartesian coordinates are gonna be fairly complicated,

57
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:34,086
and I’d be better off using polar coordinates,

58
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,083
because the radius is fixed

59
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,071
and I just talked about how the radius is—you know,

60
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:39,073
there’s this distance R,

61
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:42,058
and theta just moves from, you know, A to B, let’s say.

62
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:44,065
So depending on what I want to do.

63
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:47,003
If I want to look at straight lines, I should use Cartesian.

64
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:50,015
And if I want to look at arcs, I should probably use polar.

65
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:52,038
So, perspectives depend on the problem.

66
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,028
Now let’s think about where we want to go.

67
00:02:55,028 --> 00:02:58,094
We want to talk about how perspectives help us find solutions to problems

68
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,063
and how perspectives help us to be innovative.

69
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:04,047
Well, if you look at the history of science a lot of great breakthroughs—

70
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:06,028
you know, we think about Newton,

71
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,080
you know, his theory of gravity—

72
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,048
you can think about people actually having new perspectives on old problems.

73
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:13,029
Let’s take an example.

74
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:16,096
So, Mendeleev came up with the periodic table,

75
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,000
and in the periodic table he represents the elements by atomic weight.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,043
He’s got them in these different columns.

77
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:26,011
In doing so, by organizing the elements by atomic weight

78
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:27,078
he found all sorts of structure.

79
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:30,093
So all the metals line one column, stuff like that.

80
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:33,000
Remember—from high school chemistry class.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,093
That’s a perspective: It’s a representation of a set of possible elements.

82
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:39,007
He could’ve organized them alphabetically.

83
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:41,009
But that wouldn’t have made much sense.

84
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,067
So alphabetic representation wouldn’t give us any structure.

85
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:47,042
Atomic weight representation gives us a lot of structure.

86
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:50,085
In fact, when Mendeleev wrote down

87
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:53,086
all the elements that were around at the time according to atomic weight,

88
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:56,064
there were gaps in his representation.

89
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:59,015
There were holes for elements that were missing.

90
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:02,049
Those elements became scandium, gallium, and germanium.

91
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,056
They were eventually found ten to fifteen years later,

92
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:06,065
after he’d written down the periodic table:

93
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:08,094
People went out and were able to find the missing elements.

94
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:11,005
That perspective, atomic weight,

95
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:16,005
ended up being a very useful way to organize our thinking about the elements.

96
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,031
We do it all the time now.

97
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:20,091
When you have any sort of task,

98
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:23,067
you’ll find that you’re actually using some sort of perspective.

99
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:26,000
Suppose that you’re hiring someone.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,034
And you’ve got a bunch of recent college graduates who apply for a job.

101
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,051
And you’ve gotta think,

102
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:32,029
“Okay, how do I organize all these applicants?”

103
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:33,075
Let’s say 500 applicants.

104
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:37,003
One thing you could do is you could organize them by GPA.

105
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:39,060
You could take the highest GPA down to the lowest GPA.

106
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,078
That’s be one representation.

107
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:44,067
And you might do that if you valued competence or achievement.

108
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:47,051
But you might also value work ethic.

109
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,029
And if that were the case you might instead organize

110
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:53,024
those same CV’s or application files by how thick they are.

111
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:56,059
[Those who’re going to do the] really thick ones are people who work really, really hard.

112
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:57,055
They’ve accomplished a lot.

113
00:04:57,055 --> 00:05:00,060
Well, the third thing you might do is you might value creativity.

114
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,060
And you might say,

115
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,021
“Well, let’s put the ones that are sort of most colorful, most interesting over here.

116
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:08,011
And the ones that are least colorful and least interesting over here.”

117
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:09,076
That’s the third way to do it.

118
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,060
Now depending on what you’re hiring for,

119
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,089
depending on who the applicants are,

120
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,072
any one of these might be fine.

121
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:20,003
The only point I’m trying to make here is that there’s different ways to organize these applicants.

122
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:21,096
In each one of those ways you organize—

123
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:22,099
whether it’s in your head,

124
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:25,051
or whether it’s formally laying them out in some way—

125
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:27,017
is a perspective.

126
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:31,094
And those perspectives will determine how hard the problem will be for you.

127
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:33,041
Let me explain why.

128
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,043
Now I want to go back to the landscape metaphor.

129
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,042
And when I think of that landscape as being rugged,

130
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:42,098
and by rugged I mean that it doesn’t look like a single peak,

131
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:45,000
that there’s lots of peaks on it.

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,044
And I want to formalize this notion of peaks.

133
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:50,031
And I do so as follows:

134
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,056
I’m going to define what I call a local optima.

135
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:55,080
A local optima is a point such that

136
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,078
if you look at the points on either side of it,

137
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:59,012
they’re lower in value.

138
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:02,040
So it’s sort of a point that locally is the highest possible value.

139
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,080
So if I look at this particular rugged landscape again,

140
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,036
there’s three local optima: 1, 2, 3.

141
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:10,035
At any one of these three points, I’d be stuck.

142
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,068
I couldn’t, if I looked to the left or to the right,

143
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:14,084
I wouldn’t find a solution that’s better.

144
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:18,093
So we think about what makes a good perspective:

145
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:23,070
A good perspective is going to be a perspective that doesn’t have many local optima.

146
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,058
A bad perspective is going to be one that has a lot of local optima.

147
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,071
Let me give you an example, okay?

148
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:31,053
So, suppose I’m coming up with a candy bar.

149
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,088
Suppose I’m tasked with coming up with a new candy bar.

150
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:39,037
So I have my team of chefs make a whole bunch of different confections for me to try,

151
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:41,012
and I want to find the very best one.

152
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:43,071
But there’re so many of them, there’s so many possibilities,

153
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,032
that I’m not even sure how to think about it.

154
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:49,014
But one way to represent those candy bars might be by the number of calories that they had.

155
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:53,009
So I can organize all the different things they make by number of calories.

156
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,088
And if I did that, maybe I’d have three local optima.

157
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:59,074
So that’s a reasonable way to represent these possible candy bars.

158
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:04,057
Alternatively, I might represent those candy bars by masticity,

159
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,092
which is chew time—

160
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,017
like, how long it takes to chew ’em.

161
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:10,075
So these would be the ones that maybe only take two minutes to chew.

162
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:13,024
And these may take twenty minutes to chew.

163
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:17,001
Well, chew time is probably not the best way to look at a candy bar.

164
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:20,082
And so, as a result, I’m going to have a landscape with many, many more peaks.

165
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:25,040
And so, because it’s got many more peaks, that’s more places I could get stuck.

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,097
So it’s not as good [as] a way to represent the possible solutions.

167
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,080
It’s not as good a perspective.

168
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,037
The best perspective would be what we call a Mount Fuji landscape,

169
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:38,043
the ideal landscape that just has one peak.

170
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:39,096
And these are called Mount Fuji landscapes,

171
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:41,015
because if you’ve ever been to Japan,

172
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,024
and you look at Mount Fuji,

173
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:43,055
it looks pretty much like this.

174
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:44,094
It’s actually not quite like this, there’s like snow on the top.

175
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:48,033
But for the most part, it looks just like one giant cone.

176
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,061
If you’re on a Mount Fuji landscape,

177
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:51,012
if you’re sitting at some point,

178
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,010
you can always just climb your way right up to the top.

179
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,093
So these single-peak landscapes are really good

180
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:57,069
because you’ve basically taken a problem

181
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,092
and made it very, very simple.

182
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:03,091
What would be an example of a Mount Fuji landscape?

183
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:06,000
I’m going to take a famous example.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,053
So, a famous example comes from scientific management,

185
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,065
and due to Frederick Taylor.

186
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:12,048
Taylor famously saw for the optimal size of a shovel.

187
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:15,045
So let’s think about the shovel size landscape.

188
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:18,025
So, on this axis, I’ve got the size of the shovel.

189
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:21,080
And on this axis, I’ve got the value.

190
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,038
And what do I mean by the value?

191
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:24,098
I don’t mean how much I can sell the shovel for,

192
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:27,049
I mean it’s like how useful the shovel is at the task.

193
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,041
So let’s suppose we’re shoveling coal

194
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,047
and I want to think about

195
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:33,039
how many pounds of coal can some[one] shovel in a day

196
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,044
as a function of the size.

197
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,089
So let’s start out here where the size is zero.

198
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,068
So this is the size of the pan.

199
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,063
If I have a shovel has a pan of size zero,

200
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,070
that’s commonly known as a stick

201
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,087
and we can’t get anything.

202
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:47,089
We’re not going to shovel anything with a stick.

203
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, if I make it bigger,

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,024
you know, make it the size of maybe like a little spoon or something,

205
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,069
then we can shovel a little bit.

206
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,098
And as I make the shovel bigger and bigger and bigger,

207
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:58,067
we, whoever, my workers, can shovel more and more coal.

208
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:02,061
But at some point, the shovel’s going to get a little bit too big.

209
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,095
And it’s going to be too heavy to lift.

210
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:06,005
And the worker’s going to get tired,

211
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,021
and I’ll shovel less,

212
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,046
he’ll shovel less and less and less and less.

213
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:11,089
And then eventually get to some point where the shovel’s so big

214
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:14,001
that he can’t even lift it,

215
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:14,090
and it’s as useless as the stick.

216
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:20,082
So if I look at value in terms of how much coal the person can shovel in a day is a function of the size of the shovel.

217
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:23,044
I’m going to get a single-eaked landscape.

218
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:24,060
That’s going to be an easy problem to solve.

219
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,054
And this idea, that we could represent scientific problems in this way,

220
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:33,094
where mechanical engineering comes in this way and then climb our way to peaks,

221
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:37,016
is the basis is something called scientific management

222
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,004
and it was the idea was

223
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:40,071
that you could then by finding these high points on these landscapes,

224
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:42,079
find optimal solutions.

225
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,090
We’re only going to find out the optimal solution for sure

226
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,025
if you hill-climb like this

227
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,061
if it’s single peaked.

228
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:51,001
If it’s rugged and looks like this mess,

229
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,041
looks like Mount Fuji landscape you’re fine,

230
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,041
but if it looks like this mess, this masticity landscape,

231
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,098
if you have a bad perspective,

232
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:57,077
well then if you climb hills

233
00:09:57,077 --> 00:10:00,056
you could get stuck just about anywhere.

234
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,071
So what you’d like is you’d like a Mount Fuji landscape,

235
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:07,067
And in the case of simple things like this shovel, that’s easy to get.

236
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,048
Let me give you another example.

237
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:10,051
This one’s a lot of fun.

238
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:12,082
This is a favorite game of mine called Sum to fifteen

239
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:14,073
and was developed by Herb Simon

240
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:17,056
who’s a Nobel Prize winner in economics.

241
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:19,082
And Sum to fifteen was developed to show people

242
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:22,050
why diverse perspectives are so useful,

243
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,015
why different ways of representing a problem can make them easy,

244
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,069
can make them like Mount Fuji,

245
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:29,004
or can make them really difficult.

246
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,031
So here’s how Sum to fifteen works.

247
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,086
There’s cards numbered from one to nine face up on a table.

248
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:36,076
There’s nine cards in front of you.

249
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:37,094
There’s two players.

250
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:41,082
Each person.takes turns, taking a card.

251
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:44,032
until all the cards are gone.

252
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:45,062
Possibly, right, it could end sooner,

253
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:50,040
if anybody ever holds three cards that add up to exactly 15, they win.

254
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,092
That’s the game. So, really simple.

255
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:54,044
Nine cards. Alternate taking cards.

256
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:58,056
If you ever get exactly three that sum to fifteen you win.

257
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:00,022
So let me show you a game.

258
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,052
Here’s a game between two people,

259
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:03,089
call them Paul and David.

260
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,025
Paul goes first,

261
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:07,091
Now you’d think when you play this game the thing to do would be to choose the five.

262
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:11,060
Paul chooses the four, which is sort of an odd choice.

263
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,040
David goes next so he takes the five.

264
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,021
Paul then takes the six.

265
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:22,087
Now the six is a strange choice because four plus six plus five equals fifteen.

266
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:25,083
So it looks like there is no way that he can win.

267
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,023
Well this will be confusing to Doug.

268
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:30,025
So Doug’s going to take the eight.

269
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:34,050
Now notice eight plus five, oops, equals thirteen.

270
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:37,071
So that means Paul has to take the two.

271
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,036
So he takes the two.

272
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,053
Well think about what happens next:

273
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:43,022
Four plus two is six.

274
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,006
So if Doug doesn’t take the nine, he’s going to lose.

275
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,056
But six plus two is eight.

276
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,060
So if Doug doesn’t take the seven he’s going to lose.

277
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,014
So what you’ve got here is that Paul has won.

278
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:55,042
No matter what Doug does, Paul’s going to win the game.

279
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:57,000
Now this is a pretty tricky game, right?

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,056
It was developed by a Nobel Prize winner.

281
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:00,087
You could imagine there’s lots of strategy involved.

282
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:05,050
I want to show you this game in a different perspective.

283
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,013
Remember the magic square from seventh grade math?

284
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:11,038
Every row adds up to fifteen—

285
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:15,050
8+3+4, 1+5+9, 6+7+2 —

286
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,088
so does every column—

287
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:20,027
8+1+6 sums up to fifteen;

288
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:22,094
3+5+7 sums up to fifteen—

289
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:24,073
and even the diagonals—

290
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:26,065
eight, five, two is fifteen;

291
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:28,046
six, five, four is fifteen.

292
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,063
Every row, every column, every diagonal sum up to fifteen.

293
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:34,010
Let me show you this game again on the Magic Square.

294
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,039
So, it’s just a different perspective on “Sum to Fifteen”.

295
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,063
Paul goes first, and takes the four.

296
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,027
Doug goes next and takes the five.

297
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,078
Paul takes the six, which is an odd choice, because now he can’t win.

298
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:50,020
Doug then takes the eight, Paul blocks him with the two.

299
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,012
But now it turns out, either the nine or seven will let Paul win.

300
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,074
What game is this?

301
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:00,060
Well, you’re right, it’s tic-tac-toe.

302
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:04,006
Sum to fifteen is just tic-tac-toe,

303
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:07,031
but on a different perspective, using a different perspective.

304
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:09,030
So if you turn Sum to Fifteen—

305
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,023
if you move the cards one to nine and put them in the magic square—

306
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:16,016
what you do is you create a Mount Fuji landscape In a sense:

307
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:18,054
You make the problem really simple.

308
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:20,049
So a lot of great breakthroughs,

309
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,083
like the periodic table,

310
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,025
Newton’s Theory of Gravity,

311
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:25,071
those are perspectives on problems

312
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,098
that turned something that was really difficult to figure out

313
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:31,000
into something that suddenly makes a lot of sense,

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,051
very easy to see the solution.

315
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,083
At least it’s something I call in my book, one of my books,
the difference,

316
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,030
I call this the Savant Existence Theorem.

317
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,050
For any problem that’s out there,

318
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,072
there exists some way to represent it,

319
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:44,051
so that you turn it into a Mt. Fuji problem.

320
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,075
Now, why is that?

321
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,026
Well, it’s actually fairly straightforward.

322
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,060
All you have to do is,

323
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,002
if you’ve got all the solutions here represented on this thing,

324
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,066
you put the very best one in the middle.

325
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,035
And then put the worst ones at the end.

326
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,089
And then just sort of line up the solutions in such a way

327
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:01,028
so that you turn it into a Mount Fuji.

328
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:02,065
So it’s very straightforward.

329
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,038
Now the thing is, in order to make the Mount Fuji,

330
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:07,013
you’d have to know the solution already.

331
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,006
This isn’t a good way to solve problems

332
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:11,088
but the point is, it exists.

333
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:13,047
So it’s always the possibility

334
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:15,022
that someone could look at particular problem and said,

335
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,039
“Hey, what if think of it this way?”

336
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,009
And doing so turn something that was really rugged

337
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,065
into something that looks like Mount Fuji.

338
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:26,000
Here is the flip side though.

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,039
There is a ton of bad perspectives.

340
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,062
So just like there’s these Mount Fuji perspectives,

341
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:34,038
there’s also lots and lots of horrible ways to look at problems.

342
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,023
Think about this:

343
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,039
Suppose I have just ten alternatives

344
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,028
and I want to think about what are all the different ways I can just put them in a line.

345
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:42,042
Well there’s ten things I could put first,

346
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,006
nine things I could put second,

347
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:45,092
eight things I could put third and so on.

348
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:51,034
So there’s 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 perspectives.

349
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:54,016
Most of those are going to not be very good.

350
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:58,038
They’re not going to organize this set of solutions in any useful way.

351
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:01,018
Particularly, only a few of them are going to create Mount Fujis.

352
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:03,079
So we think about the value of perspectives, what we get is this:

353
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,058
There’s really good ones out there,

354
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:09,072
that insightful, smart people can come up

355
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:11,082
with really good representations of problem[s]

356
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:14,041
to make the landscapes less rugged.

357
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,097
If we just think about things in random ways,

358
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:21,062
we’re likely to get a landscape that’s so rugged that we’re going to get stuck just about everywhere.

359
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:23,040
We’re not going to be able to find good solutions to the problem.

360
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,083
And we’re going to hit things that look like the masticity landscape,

361
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,020
and we’re going to get things with lots and lots of peaks.

362
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,051
Let’s move on now and talk about how we move on these landscapes.

363
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:35,093
So once I got our landscape, how do I find better solutions?

364
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:38,061
Are there other alternatives to just sort of climbing a hill?

365
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:42,020
Because that hill climbing idea really only works in one dimension.

366
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,005
What if I’ve got all sorts of dimensions?

367
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:44,087
How do I think about…

368
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,023
So what have we learned?

369
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:58,026
First thing we’ve learned is that when we go about trying to solve a problem,

370
00:15:58,026 --> 00:15:59,092
when we encode it in some way,

371
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:02,004
that’s a perspective.

372
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:06,075
And a perspective creates peaks—right, it creates these local optima.

373
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:09,074
So a better perspectives have fewer local optima.

374
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:13,025
Worse perspectives have lots of local optima.

375
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,096
And if you think about how many perspectives are out there,

376
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:18,007
we just saw there’s billions of them.

377
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:19,039
Because there’s billions of perspectives,

378
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,042
most of those probably aren’t very useful.

379
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:25,025
Some of them, though, turn problems into Mount Fujis.

380
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,011
And sometimes it takes a genius—

381
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:28,058
it takes a Newton, it takes a Mendeleev—

382
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:30,078
to come up with a way of representing reality

383
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,095
so that something that was incredibly rugged

384
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:34,056
becomes Mount Fuji–like.

385
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:36,091
Other times, if you think about the size of a shovel,

386
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:42,035
that problem most of us could probably figure out a way that problem just by shovel size,

387
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,041
so that it becomes a Mount Fuji.

388
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,036
The big point is this:

389
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:48,096
When we go about solving problems, the first thing we do is we encode them.

390
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:51,026
We have some representation of the problem.

391
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:55,051
That representation determines how hard the problem will be.

392
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:58,038
If we represent it in such a way that it’s a Mount Fuji, it’s easy.

393
00:16:58,038 --> 00:17:01,091
If we represent it in such a way that it looks like that masticity landscape,

394
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:04,081
it’s probably going to be fairly hard.

395
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:05,079
Where we want to go next,

396
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,079
is we want to talk about once we’ve got this representation of the possible solutions,

397
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,083
once we have that landscape, so to speak,

398
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,041
how do we search on that landscape?

399
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,050
So one thing we’ve talked about was climbing hills.

400
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,020
But there’s lots of different ways you can climb hills.

401
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,091
That’s what we’ll talk about next: the heuristics we use on a landscape.

402
00:17:20,091 --> 99:59:59,000
Thanks.
