00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,001
Hi. In this lecture we're talking about
problem solving. And we're talking about

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:10,042
the rule that diverse perspectives play in
finding solutions to problems. So when you

3
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:15,043
think about a problem, perspective is how
you represent it. So remember from the

4
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:19,088
previous lecture. We talked about
landscapes. We talked about landscape

5
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:24,065
being able to represent the solutions
along this axis and the value of the

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:30,030
solutions. As the, as the height. And so
this is metaphorically a way to represent

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,082
how someone might think about solving a
problem. Finding high points on their

8
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:41,002
landscape. What we want to do is take this
metaphor and formalize it and part of the

9
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:45,035
reason for this course is to get Better
lodge, I can be able to think through

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:49,052
things in a clear way. So I'm going to
take this landscape metaphor and turn it

11
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:53,053
into a formal model. So how do we do it?
The first thing we do is we formally

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,092
define what a perspective is. So we speak
math to metaphor. So what a perspective is

13
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:01,088
going to be, is it's going to be a
representation of all possible solutions.

14
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:06,000
So it's some encoding of the set of
possible solutions to the problem. Once we

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,096
have that encoding of the set of possible
solutions, then we can create our

16
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:14,024
landscape by just assigning a value to
each one of those solutions. And that will

17
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:18,073
give us a landscape picture like you saw
before. Now most of us are familiar with

18
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:23,029
perspectives, even though we don't know
it. Let me give some examples. Remember

19
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:27,067
when we took seventh grade math? We
learned about how to represent a point,

20
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:32,018
how to plot points. And we typically
learned two ways to do it. The first way,

21
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:36,079
was Cartesian coordinates. So given a
point, we would represent it by and X and

22
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,035
Y value in space. So, it might be five
units, this would be the point, let's say

23
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:46,004
five, two, right? It's five units in the X
direction, two units in the Y direction.

24
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:50,004
But we also learned another way to
represent points, and that was Cartesian

25
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:53,088
coordinates. So we can take the same
point, and say, well, there's a radius,

26
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:58,031
which is its distance from the origin, and
then there's some angle theta, which says

27
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:02,069
how far we have to sweep out, in order to,
you know, sweep that arc, radius out in

28
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,096
order to get to the point. So two totally
reasonable ways to represent a point, X

29
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:11,055
and Y, R and theta. Cartesian, polar.
Which is better? Well, [laugh], the

30
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:16,094
answer, it depends. Let me show you why.
Suppose I wanted to describe this line, in

31
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:22,016
order to describe this line I should just
use [inaudible] coordinates I can just say

32
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:26,065
Y=3 and X moves from two to five. It's
really easy. [sound]. But suppose I wanna

33
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:30,077
describe this arc. If I wanna describe
this arc, now Cartesian coordinates are

34
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:34,072
gonna be fairly complicated, and I'd be
better off using polar coordinates.

35
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:38,094
Because the radius is fixed. And I just
talked about how the radius is, you know,

36
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:43,000
there's this distance R, and theta just
moves from, you know, A to B, let's say.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,016
So depending on what I wanna do. If I
wanna look at straight lines, I should use

38
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:50,084
Cartesian. And if I wanna look at arcs, I
should probably use polar. So,

39
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:55,022
perspectives depend on the problem. Now
let's think about where we want to go. We

40
00:02:55,022 --> 00:02:59,063
want to talk about how perspectives help
us find solutions to problems. And how

41
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:04,015
perspectives help us to be innovating.
Well if you look at the history of science

42
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:08,062
a lot of great breakthroughs. You know, we
think about Newton. You know, his theory

43
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:12,097
of gravity. You can think about people
actually having new perspectives on old

44
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:16,081
problems. Let's take an example. So,
Mendeleev. Came up with the periodic

45
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:21,011
table. In the periodic table he represents
the elements by atomic weight. He's got

46
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:25,041
them in these different columns. In doing
so, by organizing the elements by atomic

47
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,061
weight he found all sorts of structure.
Right, so all the metals line one column,

48
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:33,075
stuff like that, right? Remember that from
high school chemistry class. That's a

49
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:37,079
perspective, it's a representation of a
set of possible elements. He could've

50
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,061
organized them alphabetically. But that
wouldn't have made much sense. So

51
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:45,037
alphabetic representation wouldn't give us
any structure. Atomic weight

52
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:50,070
representation gives us a lot of
structure. In fact, when Mendeleev. You

53
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,029
know, wrote down all the elements that
were around at the time, according to

54
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:57,091
atomic weight. There were gaps in his
representation. There where holes for

55
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:02,005
elements that were missing. Those elements
became scandium, gallium, and germanium.

56
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:06,030
They were eventually found ten to fifteen
years later. After he'd written down the

57
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,038
periodic table, people went out and were
able to find the missing elements. That

58
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:14,075
perspective, atomic way. Ended up being a
very useful way to organize our thinking

59
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:18,092
about the elements. We do it all the time
now. When you have any sort of task,

60
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:23,014
you'll find that you're actually using
some sort of perspective. Suppose that

61
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:27,037
you're hiring someone. And you've got a
bunch of recent college graduates who

62
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:31,031
apply for a job. And you've gotta think,
okay, how do I organize all these

63
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:35,053
applicants, let's say, 500 applicants.
Well, one thing you could do is you could

64
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:40,003
organize them by GPA. You could take the
highest GPA down to the lowest GPA. That's

65
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:44,031
be one representation. And you might do
that, right, if you valued competence or

66
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:48,053
achievement. But you might also value work
ethic. And if that were the case you might

67
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:52,030
instead organize those same, you know,
CV's or application files by how thick

68
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,007
they are. Their gonna feel like really
think ones are people who work really,

69
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:59,094
really hard. They've accomplished a lot.
Well, the third thing you might do is you

70
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:03,082
might value creativity. And you might say,
"Well, let's put the ones that are sort of

71
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:07,051
most colorful, most interesting, over
here. And the ones that are least colorful

72
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:11,025
and least interesting over here." That's
the third way to do it. Now depending on

73
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:15,012
what you're hiring for, depending on who
the applicants are, any one of these might

74
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:18,095
be fine. The only point I'm trying to make
here is that there's different ways to

75
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:22,079
organize these applicants. In each one of
those ways you organize, whether it's in

76
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,079
your head, or whether it's formally laying
them out in some way. Is a perspective.

77
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,070
And those perspectives will determine how
hard the problem will be for you. Let me

78
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,062
explain why. Now I wanna take, I wanna go
back to the landscape metaphor. And when I

79
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:41,031
think of that landscape as being rugged,
and by rugged I mean that it's not, it

80
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:46,012
doesn't look like a single peak. That
there's lots of peaks on it. And I want to

81
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:51,034
formalize this notion of peaks. And I do
so as follow. I'm going to define what I

82
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:56,069
call a local optima. A local optima is a
point such that, if you look at the points

83
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,046
on either side of it, they're lower in
value. So it's sort of a point that

84
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:06,049
locally is the highest possible value. So
if I look at this particular rugged

85
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:10,093
landscape again, there's three local
optima, one, two, three. So at any one of

86
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:15,069
these three points, I'd be stuck. I
couldn't, if I looked to the left or to

87
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:20,037
the right, I wouldn't find a solution
that's better. A perspective is gonna be,

88
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:24,019
a good perspective is gonna be a
perspective that doesn't have many local

89
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:28,026
optima. A bad perspective is gonna be one
that has a lot of local optima. Let me

90
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:32,030
give you an example, okay? So, suppose I'm
coming up with a candy bar. Suppose I'm

91
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,023
tasked with coming up with a new candy
bar. So I have my team of chefs make a

92
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:40,001
whole bunch of different, you know,
confections for me to try, and I want to

93
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:44,000
find the very best one. So many of them,
there's so many possibilities, not even

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,035
sure how to think about it. But one way to
represent those candy bars might be by the

95
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:52,054
number of calories that they have. So I
can organize all the different things they

96
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:56,058
make by number of calories. And if I did
that, maybe I'd have three local optima.

97
00:06:56,058 --> 00:07:00,078
So that's a reasonable way to represent
these possible candy bars. Alternatively,

98
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:05,028
I might represent those candy bars by
masticity, which is chew time. Like, how

99
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:09,084
long it takes to chew'em. So these would
be the ones that maybe only take two

100
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:14,034
minutes to chew. And these may take twenty
minutes to chew. Well, chew time is

101
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:18,096
probably not the best way to look at a
candy bar. And so, as a result, I'm gonna

102
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:23,017
have a landscape with many, many more
peaks. And so, because it's got many more

103
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:26,084
peaks, that's more places I could get
stuck. So it's not as good of a way to

104
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:30,042
represent the possible solutions. It's not
as good a perspective. The best

105
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:34,043
perspective would be what we call a Mount
Fuji landscape, the ideal landscape that

106
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:38,030
just has one peak. And these are called
Mount Fuji landscapes, because if you've

107
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,031
ever been to Japan, and you look at Mount
Fuji, it looks pretty much like this. It's

108
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:46,037
actually not quite like this, there's like
snow on the top. But for the most part, it

109
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:50,014
looks just like one giant cone. If you're
on a Mount Fuji landscape, if you're

110
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:53,099
sitting at some point, you can always just
climb your way. Right up to the top. So

111
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,059
these single peak landscapes are really
good because, you've basically taken a

112
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:03,004
problem. And made it very, very simple.
What would be an example of a Mount Fuji

113
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:07,027
landscape? I'm gonna take a famous
example. So, a famous example comes from

114
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:11,056
scientific management, and due to
Frederick Taylor. Taylor famously saw for

115
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:16,014
the optimal size of a shovel. So let's
think about the shovel size landscape. So,

116
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:20,042
on this axis, I've got the size of the
shovel. And on this axis, I've got the

117
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:24,079
value. What do I mean by the value? I
don't mean how much I can sell the shovel

118
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,099
for, I mean it's like how useful the
shovel is at the task. So let's suppose

119
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:33,052
we're shoveling coal and I want to think
about how many pounds of coal can some

120
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:38,022
shovel in a day as a function of the size.
So let's start out here where the size is

121
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:42,058
zero. So this is the size of the pan. If I
have a shovel has a pan of size zero,

122
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:46,087
that's commonly known as a stick and we
can. Get anything. We're not gonna shovel

123
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:50,072
anything with a stick. Well, if I make it
bigger, you know, make it the size of,

124
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:54,078
maybe, like, a little spoon or something,
then we can shovel a little bit. And as I

125
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:58,037
make the shovel bigger and bigger and
bigger, we, whoever, my workers, can

126
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:02,043
shovel more and more coal. But at some
point, the shovel's gonna get a little bit

127
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:06,017
too big. And it's gonna be too heavy to
lift. And the worker's gonna get tired,

128
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:09,055
and I'll shovel, he'll shovel less and
less and less and less. And then

129
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:13,037
eventually get to some point where the
shovel's so big that he can't even lift

130
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:17,018
it, and it's as useless as the stick. So
if I look at value in terms of how much

131
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:21,004
coal the person can shovel in a day is a
function of the size of the shovel. I'm

132
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:24,076
gonna get a single peaked landscape.
That's gonna be an easy problem to solve.

133
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:30,007
And this idea, that we could represent
scientific problems in this way. Where

134
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:34,018
mechanical engineering comes in this way
and then climb our way to peaks, is the

135
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:38,014
basis is something called scientific
management and it was the idea was that

136
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:42,014
you could then by finding these high
points on these landscapes, find possible

137
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:46,010
solutions. We're only going to find out a
solution, right, for sure if you hill

138
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,010
climb like this if it's single peaked. If
it's rugged and looks like this mess,

139
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,095
looks like Mount Fuji landscape you're
fine, but if it looks like this miss,

140
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:57,096
mess, this city landscape, if you have a
bad perspective, well then if you climb

141
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:02,027
hills you could get stuck. Just about
anywhere, so what you'd like is you'd like

142
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:07,000
a Mount Fuji landscape and in the case of
simple things like this shovel. That's

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,069
easy to get. Let me give you another
example. This one's a lot of fun. This is

144
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:16,008
a favorite game of mine called Sum to
fifteen and was developed by Herb Simon

145
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:20,064
who's a Nobel Prize winner in economics.
And Sum to fifteen was developed to show

146
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:25,020
people why diverse perspectives are so
useful and different ways of representing

147
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,048
a problem can make them easy, can make
them like Mount Fuji or can make them

148
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:33,087
difficult. Okay? So here's how Sum to
fifteen works. There's cards numbered from

149
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,032
one to nine face up on a table. There's
nine cards in front of you. Each, there's

150
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:43,064
two players, each person. Takes turns,
taking a card. Until all the cards are

151
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:48,071
gone possibly right, it could end sooner,
if anybody ever holds three cards that add

152
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:53,026
up to exactly fifteen they win. That's the
game. So release up to nine cards.

153
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:58,015
Alternate taking cards. If you ever get
exactly three that sum to fifteen you win.

154
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:02,086
So let me show you a game. Here's a game
between two people, call them Paul and

155
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:07,048
David. Paul goes first, now you'd think
when you play this game the thing to do

156
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:12,027
would be to choose the five. Paul chooses
the four, which is sort of an odd choice.

157
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:17,045
David goes next so he takes the five. Paul
then takes the six. Now the six is a

158
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:23,022
strange choice because four plus six plus
five equals fifteen. So it looks like

159
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:29,036
there is no way that he can win. Well this
will be confusing to Doug. So Doug's gonna

160
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:34,098
take the eight. Now notice eight plus
five, oops, equals thirteen. So that means

161
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:40,082
Paul has to take the two. So he takes the
two. Well think about what happens next.

162
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:46,037
Four plus two is six, so if Doug doesn't
take the nine, he's gonna lose. But six

163
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:50,055
plus two, is eight. So if Doug doesn't
take the seven he's gonna lose. So what

164
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:54,079
you've got here, is that Paul's won. No
matter what Doug does, Paul's gonna win

165
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,001
the game. Now this is a pretty tricky
game, right? It was developed by a Nobel

166
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:03,034
Prize winner. You could imagine there's
lots of strategy involved. I wanna show

167
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:07,078
you this game in a different perspective.
Remember the magic square from seventh

168
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:13,013
grade math? Every row adds up to fifteen:
eight+3+4, one+5+9, six+7+2. So does every

169
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:18,094
column: eight+1+6 sums up to fifteen;
three+5+7 sums up to fifteen. And even the

170
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:24,083
diagonals: eight, five, two is fifteen;
six, five, four is fifteen. Every row,

171
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:31,030
every column, every diagonal sum up to
fifteen. Let me show you this game again

172
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:38,003
on the Magic Square. So, just a different
perspective on sums of fifteen. Paul goes

173
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:43,077
first, and takes the four. Doug goes next
and takes the five. Paul takes the six,

174
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:49,024
which is an odd choice, because now he
can't win. Doug then takes the eight, Paul

175
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:54,070
blocks him with the two. But now it turns
out, either the nine or seven will let

176
00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:00,038
Paul win. What game is this? You're right,
it's tic tac toe. Sum to fifteen is just

177
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:04,054
tic tac toe, but on a different
perspective, using a different

178
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:09,073
perspective. So if you turn sum to
fifteen, if you move the cards one to nine

179
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:15,033
and put them in the magic square, what you
do is you create a Mount Fuji landscape.

180
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:19,082
In a sense, right? You make the problem
really simple. So a lot of great

181
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:23,074
breakthroughs, like the periodic table,
Newton's Theory of Gravity, those are

182
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:27,071
perspectives on problems that turned
something that was really difficult to

183
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:31,099
figure out into something that suddenly
makes a lot of sense. Very easy to see the

184
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:35,065
solution. At least it?s something I call
in my book, one of my books, the

185
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:39,056
difference, I call this the savant
existence theorem. For any problem that's

186
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:43,048
out there, there exists some way to
represent it, so that you turn it into a

187
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:47,039
Mt. Fuji problem. Now, why is that? Well,
it's actually fairly straightforward. All

188
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,055
you have to do is, you know, if you've got
all the solutions here represented on this

189
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:55,056
thing, you put the very best one in the
middle. And then put the worst ones at the

190
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:59,038
end. And then just sort of line up the
solutions in [inaudible] A, so that you

191
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:03,009
turn it into a Mount Fuji. So it's very
straightforward. Now the thing is, in

192
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,081
order to make the Mount Fuji, you'd
already, you'd have to know the solution

193
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:11,046
already. This isn't a good way to solve
problems but the point is, it exist. So

194
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:16,039
it's always the possible that someone
could look at particular problem and said,

195
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:21,014
hey what if thing of it this way? And
doing so turn something that was really

196
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:26,078
rugged into something now Fuji. Here is
the flip side though. There is a ton of

197
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,052
bad perspectives. So just like there's
these Mount Fuji perspectives, there's

198
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:34,010
also lots and lots of horrible ways to
look at problems. Think about this.

199
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,079
Suppose I have just, you know, ten
alternatives and I wanna think about what

200
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,087
are all the different ways I can just put
them in a line. Well there's ten things I

201
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:45,089
could put first, nine things I could put
second, eight things I could put third and

202
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,068
so on. So there's ten times nine times
eight times seven times six times five

203
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:53,080
times four times three times two times one
perspectives. Most of those. Are going to

204
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,080
not be very good. They're not going to
organize this set of solutions in any

205
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,017
useful way. Particularly they're not going
to, only a few of them are going to create

206
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:06,028
Mount Fujis. So we think about the value
of perspective, what we get is, there's

207
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:10,012
really good ones out there. That
insightful, smart people can come up with

208
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:14,030
really good representations of problem to
make the landscapes less rugged. If we

209
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,022
just think about things in random ways,
we're likely to get a landscape that's so

210
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:22,014
rugged that we're going to get stuck just
about everywhere. We're not going to be

211
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:25,067
able to find good solutions to the
problem. And we're going to get things

212
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:29,049
that look like domesticity landscape,
where we're going to get things with lots

213
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:33,045
and lots of P. Let's move on now and talk
about how we move on these landscapes. So

214
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:36,093
once I got our landscape, how do I find
better solutions? Are there other

215
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:40,065
alternatives to just sort of climbing a
hill? Because that hill climbing idea

216
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:44,052
really only works in one dimension. What
if I've got all sorts of dimensions? How

217
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:57,045
do I think about. [sound]. So what have we
learned? First thing we've learned is that

218
00:15:57,045 --> 00:16:01,064
when you go about trying to solve a
problem, when you encode it in some way,

219
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:05,088
that's a perspective. And a perspective
creates peaks, right, it creates these

220
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:10,030
local optima. So a better perspective has
fewer local optima. Worse perspectives

221
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,071
have lots of local optima. And if you
think about how many perspectives are out

222
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:18,067
there, we just saw there's billions of
them. Because there's billions of

223
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:22,081
perspectives, most of those probably
aren't very useful. Some of them, though,

224
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,075
turn problems into Mount Fujis. And
sometimes it takes a genius. It takes a

225
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:31,012
Newton, it takes a Mendeleev, to come up
with a way of representing reality so that

226
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:35,017
something that was incredibly rugged
becomes Mount Fuji like. Other times, if

227
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:39,060
you think about the size of a shovel, that
problem most of us could probably figure

228
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,002
out a way to represent that problem just
by shovel size, so that it becomes a Mount

229
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:48,028
Fuji. The big point is this. When we go
about solving problems, the first thing we

230
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:51,096
do is we encode them. We have some
representation of the problem. That

231
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:55,075
representation determines how hard the
problem will be. If we represent.

232
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:59,087
[inaudible] Effectuated it's a Mount Fuji,
it's easy. If we run it, represent it

233
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:04,023
sectionally with that masticity landscape,
it's probably gonna be fairly hard. Where

234
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,033
we wanna go next, is we wanna talk about
once we've got this representation of the

235
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:12,012
possible solutions, once we have that
landscape, so to speak, how do we search

236
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:15,076
on that landscape? So one thing we've
talked about was climbing hills. But

237
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:19,076
there's lots of different ways you can
climb hills. That's what we'll talk about

238
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:22,020
next, the heuristics we use on a
landscape. Thanks.
