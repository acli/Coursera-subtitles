00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,079
Hi, in this set of lectures we are going to talk about problem solving.

2
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:07,053
We’re going to talk about individuals and teams go about solving problems.

3
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:09,014
and we’re going to focus on a couple of things —

4
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:12,005
We're going to talk about the role that diversity plays in problem solving,

5
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:15,085
and we’re also going to talk about how ideas can get recombined,

6
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,092
and how a lot of innovation actually comes from

7
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:21,019
somebody having an idea in one place and it  being applied someplace else.

8
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:26,080
So, those are going to be the two main themes: The role of diversity, and the power of recombination.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,096
So to get there, think about how we model problem solving: We got to start off by making it more formal,

10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,096
constructing a somewhat formal model.

11
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:37,004
So here is how we are going to do it: We are going to assume that you take some sort of action (a),

12
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,003
where you have some sort of solution we’ll represent by (a),

13
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,066
and there's a payout function (F), that gives you the value of that particular action.

14
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:47,076
So that action could be a particular string of code if you are writing computer code,

15
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:50,079
and (F) might be how fast that code runs.

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,040
Alternatively,  (a) could be a health care policy and (F) would be how efficient that health care policy is.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,001
So, (a) is the solution that you propose and F(a)  (F of a)  is how good the solution is.

18
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,063
What we want to do is to have some kind of an understanding [of]

19
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:09,057
how people come up with better solutions — where innovation comes from.

20
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:11,086
So to do that we are going to invoke a metaphor.

21
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:18,021
And we are going to use this 'metaphor of a landscape' as a lens through which to interpret our models.

22
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:20,079
Okay, so, think about it in the following way:

23
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,010
You are trying to come up with some solution to a problem, and each solution has a value.

24
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,076
So the altitude here is the value of it.

25
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:31,006
So,  B   is the best possible solution.

26
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:35,014
Now, along here on the X-axis, these are all the different solutions.

27
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,052
So I might start out by having some Idea (I)

28
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:39,091
(Let’s just put it right here, and here’s my idea.)

29
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:43,036
And it's an okay idea; but we’d like to think about “How do we find better ideas?”

30
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:46,097
So one think we might do is [we] might “try things to the left and the right,”

31
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:51,026
and realize that  “climb uphill” here and we get to some point (C);

32
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:55,056
and (C) might be where I get stuck, because if I go to the left I’m lower, and if I go to the right I’m lower,

33
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:58,083
so I could say “Wait, (C) is the best thing I can come up with.”

34
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,062
What we want to see is  how people come up with these ideas,

35
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:03,079
how teams of people come up with better ideas,

36
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,063
and how we can avoid getting stuck on (C),

37
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:08,082
and possibly getting ourselve[s] up to (B).

38
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:12,052
How are we going to do it? Well, here’s what the model is going to look like:

39
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:16,088
We are going to start out by talking about something I am going to call ‘perspectives’.

40
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:21,010
What is a perspective? Perspective is how you represent a problem.

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,021
So if someone poses some problem to you—

42
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:25,065
again, whether it is code, health care policy,

43
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:29,063
designing a bycicle, or designing an addition to you house—

44
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:32,046
you have some way of representing that problem in your head.

45
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:37,039
That's going to be a perspective — it’s literally how you encode the problem.

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,039
Once you have encoded the problem, what you do is you create—again, this is metaphorically—a ‘landscape’.

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,096
as if you can think of your encoding is like that horizontal axis,

48
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:49,050
and that there is a value for each possible solution,

49
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,043
and that creates a landscape.

50
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:56,033
So we are going to talk about how different perspectives give different landscapes.

51
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,053
That is the first part.

52
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:59,097
[The] second part is something I’m going to call ‘heuristics’.

53
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:02,041
Heuristics are how you move on the landscape.

54
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,006
So, remember when I drew that landscape,

55
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:06,006
I talked about climbing up the 'hill'.

56
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,020
Well, 'Hill Climbing' is one heuristic.

57
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,083
'Random Search' would be another heuristic — if you just randomly pick some points

58
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:15,013
and then find which one is where the highest value is, that is another heuristic.

59
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:18,059
So we will talk about how different perspectives and different heruistics

60
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:22,039
allow people to  find a better or improving solutions to problems.

61
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,076
So that is going to be the focus of our model of problem solving:

62
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:28,062
People have perspectives, and people have heuristics.

63
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:32,000
Once we finish talking about individuals, then we will talk about teams.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,002
One of the interesting things here is if you have groups of people or [a] team of people solving a problem.

65
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:38,094
You actually can show that they will be better than the individuals in it.

66
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:42,065
And the reason why is because they have more tools, and those tools tend to be diverse.

67
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:46,066
So they have different perspectives and different heuristics, and all that diversity makes them better

68
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:50,010
coming up with new solutions and better solutions to problems.

69
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,068
So, teams are going to be important.

70
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,073
After we have talked about teams,

71
00:03:54,073 --> 00:04:00,010
and after we have talked about the role of how one person can improve upon the solution of another,

72
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,086
we are going to extend our model a little bit and talk about  recombination.

73
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:06,012
So here is sort of the big idea. The big idea is this:

74
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:10,002
I have some solution from one problem, you have a solution from a different problem,

75
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:13,009
and sometimes I can take your solution and combine it with my solution,

76
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,019
and come up with something even better.

77
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,026
So, the thing about sophisticated products—

78
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:20,080
like a house, an automobile, or even a computer—

79
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,011
that consists of all sorts of solutions to sub-problems.

80
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,055
And we are going to see how by recombining solutions to sub-problems

81
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:31,099
we get ever better solutions, and that is really a big driver of innovation.

82
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,080
So let us think back for a second — Remember in our previous lecture,

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,013
we talked about how without sustained innovation we no longer get growth,

84
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:40,039
that growth depends on sustained innovation.

85
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,032
What we’re going to talk about here is how diversity leads to innovations,

86
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:48,023
and how recombinations of innovations  can lead to even more Innovations.

87
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:50,093
So that is the big theme — So that is where we are headed:

88
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:54,083
We are going to start by  talking about perspectives. Then we will talk about heuristics.

89
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:59,045
Then we will talk about how teams of people can leverage their diverse perspectives in heuristics.

90
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:04,036
And then we’ll talk about recombining ideas can really drive a lot of growth.

91
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:09,028
All right, let’s get started. Thank you!
