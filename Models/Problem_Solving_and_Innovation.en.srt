00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,020
Hi, in this set lectures we are going to talk about problem solving.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,009
We are here to talk about individuals and teams go about solving problems.

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,059
We are here to focus on a couple of things.

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,053
We're going to talk about the role that diversity plays in problem solving,

5
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:16,039
and were also going to talk about how ideas can get recombinded.

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,060
How a lot of innovation comes from somebody having an idea in one place, and it  being applied someplace else.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,018
Those are going to be the two main themes:

8
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:26,060
The role of diversity, and the power of recombination.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,073
So to get there, think about how we model problem solving.

10
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:31,089
We got to start off by making it more formal,

11
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,037
constructing a somewhat formal model.

12
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:34,084
So here is how we are going to do it:

13
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:37,060
We are going to assume you take some sort of action (a),

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,050
where you have some sort of solution (a),

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,020
and there's a payout function (F) that gives you the value of that particular action.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,060
That action could be a particular string of code

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,079
if you are writing computer code, and (F) might be how fast that code runs.

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,029
Alternatively,  (a) could be a health care policy

19
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:57,060
and (F) would be how efficient that health care policy is.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,074
So, (a) is the solution that you propose

21
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:03,029
and F(a)  (F of a)  is how good the solution is.

22
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:07,090
What we want to do is somewhat understand how people come up with better solutions,

23
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,090
and where innovation comes from.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,002
So to do that we are going to invoke a metaphor.

25
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:18,059
And we are going to use this 'metaphor of a landscape' as a lens through which to interpret our models.

26
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:20,073
Okay, so, think about it in the following way.

27
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:23,040
You are trying to come up with some solution to a

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,079
problem, and each solution has a value.

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,029
So the altitude here is the value of it.

30
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:31,000
So,  B   is the best possible solution.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,029
Now, along here on the X-axis are all the different solutions.

32
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,073
So I might start out having some Idea (I)

33
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,091
(Let’s just put it right here, and here’s my idea.)

34
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:41,065
and it's an okay idea;

35
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:43,086
but we would like to think about how we find better ideas?

36
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,082
So one think you might do is

37
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:47,033
you might sort of try things to the left and the right,

38
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:49,050
and realize that  sort of climb uphill here

39
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,040
and you get to some point (C)

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,003
and (C) might be where I get stuck,

41
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:55,010
because if I go to the left I’m lower,

42
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,044
and to the right I’m lower,

43
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:59,021
so I can say “Wait, (C) is the best thing I can come up with.”

44
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,090
What we want to see is  how people come up with these ideas,

45
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,006
how teams of people come up with better ideas,

46
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,090
and how we can avoid getting stuck on (C),

47
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,099
and possibly getting myself up to (B).

48
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:10,081
How are we going to do it?

49
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:12,064
Well, here’s what the model is going to look like:

50
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:14,087
We are going to start out by talking about

51
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,099
something I am going to call ‘perspectives’.

52
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,063
What is a perspective?

53
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:21,030
Perspective is how you represent the problem.

54
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,021
So if someone poses some problem to you—

55
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:25,065
again, whether it is code, health care policy,

56
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:29,063
designing a bycicle, or designing an addition to you house—

57
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:32,076
you have some way of representing the problem in your head.

58
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:34,050
That's going to be a perspective,

59
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,040
literally how you encode the problem.

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,062
Once you have encoded the problem, what you do is

61
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:43,040
you create—again, this is metaphorically—a ‘landscape’.

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,096
as if you can think of your encoding is like that horizontal axis,

63
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:49,050
and that there is a value for each possible solution,

64
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,043
and that creates a landscape.

65
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:53,055
So we are going to talk about how different perspectives

66
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:55,073
give different landscapes.

67
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:57,053
That is the first part.

68
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:59,097
[The] second part is something I’m going to call ‘heuristics’.

69
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:02,041
Heuristics are how you move on the landscape.

70
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,021
So, remember when I drew that landscape,

71
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:06,006
I talked about climbing up the 'hill'.

72
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,020
Well, 'Hill Climbing' is one heuristic.

73
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,059
'Random Search' would be another heuristic—

74
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,025
if you just randomly pick some points

75
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,071
and then find which one is where the highest value is—

76
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,083
That is another heuristic.

77
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,039
So we will talk about

78
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,096
how different perspectives and different heruistics

79
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:22,090
allow people to  find a better or improving solutions to problems.

80
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,030
So that is going to be the focus of our model of problem solving.

81
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,050
People have perspectives, and people have heuristics.

82
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,059
Once we finish talking about individuals,

83
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,030
then we will talk about teams.

84
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,069
One of the interesting things is if you have groups of people

85
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,059
or teams of people solving a problem.

86
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:38,022
You actually can show that they will be better

87
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:39,059
than the individuals in it.

88
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,080
And the reason why is because they have more tools,

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,029
and those tools tend to be diverse.

90
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:45,021
So they have different perspectives and different heuristics,

91
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:46,085
and all that diversity makes them better

92
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:50,010
coming up with new solutions and better solutions to problems.

93
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,069
So, teams are going to be important.

94
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,026
After we have talked about teams,

95
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,036
and after we have talked about the role of

96
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,011
how one person can improve upon the solution of another,

97
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:02,046
we are going to extend our model a little bit

98
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,034
and talk about  recombination.

99
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,012
So here is sort of the big idea. The big idea is this:

100
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,080
I have some solution from one problem,

101
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,022
you have a solution from a different problem,

102
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:13,009
and sometimes I can take your solution and combine it with my solution,

103
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,019
and come up with something even better.

104
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,042
So, the thing about sophisticated products—

105
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,080
like a house, an automobile, or even a computer—

106
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,011
that consists of all sorts of solutions to sub-problems.

107
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,030
And we are going to see how

108
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,060
by recombining solutions to sub-problems

109
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,027
we get ever better solutions, and that is a big driver of innovation.

110
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,019
So let us think back for a second.

111
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,010
Remember on our previous lecture,

112
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,051
we talked about how without sustained innovation

113
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:38,019
we no longer get growth,

114
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,039
that growth depends on sustained innovation.

115
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,087
What I am going to talk about here is

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,064
how diversity leads to innovations,

117
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:48,046
and how recombinations of innovations  can lead to even more Innovations.

118
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:50,019
So that is the big theme.

119
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,027
So that is where we are headed.

120
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,036
We are going to start by  talking about perspectives.

121
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,089
Then we will talk about heuristics.

122
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:57,004
Then we will talk about how teams of people

123
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,096
can leverage their diverse perspective in heuristics.

124
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:04,010
The we will talk about recombining ideas can really drive a lot of growth.

125
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,097
All right, let’s get started.

126
00:05:05,097 --> 99:59:59,000
Thank you!
