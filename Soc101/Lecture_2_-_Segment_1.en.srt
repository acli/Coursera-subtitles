1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,075
I'd like to follow-up on our last lecture
about the sociological imagination and

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:10,087
talk about three questions that are
characteristic of the discipline of

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:16,070
sociology, and the first is: How are the
things that we take to be natural socially

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,032
constructed? How are the things that we
take to be natural socially constructed?

5
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:28,072
There's a basic flaw in common sense, and
human reasoning more generally, that goes

6
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:34,074
something like this. The things we see
before us every day are supposed to be

7
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:40,049
that way, they come from nature But
sociology teaches us, that Many of the

8
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:46,050
things that we, think are natural Are
actually man and woman made, Which does

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,098
not necessarily mean this makes us, freer
from so called nature. In fact, we may not

10
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:59,049
be As free as we think, even armed with
this insight But that hasn't stopped many

11
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:05,028
people from using the inside to try to
bring about very important social changes.

12
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:11,061
Some of which have succeeded and some of
which, are slow to progress For example,

13
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:17,058
let's say that you go up to a baby or a
small child on the street, at least here

14
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:23,040
in Princeton, New Jersey, Perhaps in a
stroller or crawling next to the parents.

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,029
What's the first question you're going to
ask those parents? Very likely you're

16
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:35,067
gonna say, "Does your child have a penis
or a vagina?" You need to know the answer

17
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:41,042
to that question right? Because without
knowing the answer to that question you

18
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:46,088
cannot precede any further in the
interaction. That is if you are a typical

19
00:01:46,088 --> 00:01:52,077
human being like me And this is because
without knowing if the child has a penis

20
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:59,022
or a vagina you don't really know how to
interact with that child. Now in fact,

21
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:05,015
it's probably not the best thing in the
world to ask that question in that way to

22
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:10,093
a parent. In fact, if you were to go up
and ask the question in that way, at least

23
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:16,057
here in Princeton and all of the other
places where I have lived, you would be

24
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:22,046
considered very unusual, if not strange.
So instead, we ask the question in a more

25
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:28,055
benign way. We say is your child a boy, or
a girl. Well, actually, even if you ask it

26
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:34,041
like that, some parents will not be
thrilled because they want to believe that

27
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:40,042
you can tell what their child is. Which
highlights how significant it is that we

28
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:46,028
be able to interact with a child in an
appropriate way So when you go up to a

29
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:52,006
child on the street, the first thing you
might say to a parent is; what's your

30
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:58,056
baby's name? That's a kind of subtle way
of asking the sex of the boy or the girl

31
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:04,098
without saying I can't really tell if your
child is a boy or a girl And once you

32
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:09,097
figure out whether or not you are
interacting with a boy or a girl, that

33
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:15,050
might cause some significant difference in
the way that you will in, interact, or

34
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,059
what you will say next. So if you find out
that it is a little boy named Michael,

35
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:25,061
which is a popular boy's name. When people
currently at Princeton were born in the

36
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:30,026
early'90s, you might say, hey buddy, how
are you doing? Or if you find out that

37
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:34,092
it's a little girl named Ashley, which was
also a popular girl's name in the

38
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:39,070
early'90s, when many of the students at
Princeton who are here today were born.

39
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,041
You might say, hi sweetie, how are you?
That will be the beginning of a kind of

40
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:50,048
interaction that is gender based. By
gender, we mean The social, cultural and

41
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:56,098
psychological meanings. Which get
attributed to sex And I'd be curious by

42
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:03,098
the way, about how this all works In the
places that you live. Why is gender so

43
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:09,042
important to social interaction? There's
nothing else quite like that. If we go up

44
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:14,080
to a baby on the street, and we don't know
what race they are, we can pretty well

45
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,025
interact with them, at least here in the
United States. Sure, there are parents who

46
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:25,076
will signal a certain racial affiliation
by how they fix the child's hair, or what

47
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:31,013
kind of garments they have the child wear,
but on the whole, people don't need to

48
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:36,029
know the race of a child in order to
interact with it. Whether the child is

49
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:41,029
black or white or Latino or Asian for
example, is not going to have a

50
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:47,038
significant impact on the nature of the
interaction. The same thing with social

51
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:52,084
class, right? We don't really need to know
what social class a child comes from in

52
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:58,024
ord er to interact with it. In order for
an interaction to be successful, we don't

53
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:03,077
need to know whether a child is from the
working classes or the middle classes or

54
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:09,031
the upper middle classes or that group
that has become popularly known as the top

55
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:15,002
one percent. There are many of the people
of the upper classes who dress their

56
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:19,087
children in clothes from the Gap or Old
Navy Stores which sell their products very

57
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:24,073
widely to people of many different classes
And likewise, there are many poor people

58
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:29,024
in the United States who dress their
children in labels that come from elite

59
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:34,052
names like Ralph Lauren or Tommy Hilfiger.
You can't necessarily tell what social

60
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:39,075
class a baby comes from And more
importantly, you don't feel you need to

61
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:45,063
know But gender is completely different.
You expect to know the gender of a child

62
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:51,077
before you can interact with it. Now the
one thing that occurs to you, or to me

63
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:57,005
when you need to know the gender of a
child and that all interactions are

64
00:05:57,005 --> 00:06:03,018
gendered from the beginning is you come to
the realization that from a very early age

65
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:09,002
a child is going to be enacting the role
of a boy or a girl. They re gonna respond

66
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:14,073
to the expectations of the people around
them with regard to gender And through

67
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:20,064
processes of interaction, they are going
to come to think about themselves as a boy

68
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:26,026
or a girl And because this happens at such
a young age, when they're infants, in

69
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:30,087
fact. We can see the ways that gender
expectations come to be socially

70
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:37,000
constructed at the earliest part of life.
Now this is not to suggest that this thing

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,054
I am saying is social, does not have some
biological basis to it. This is not to

72
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:48,035
suggest that brain science does not have a
significant amount to contribute to our

73
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:53,060
understanding by looking at the
differences between male and female brains

74
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,012
But that what it does suggest is that
there is a very strong component of male

75
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:04,062
and female that is socially constructed.
Part of my agenda in this lecture is not

76
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:09,095
to say that the biological is a residual
category that doesn't matter, but to say

77
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:15,007
that we're going to engage in an enter
prise of disentangling. To try to figure

78
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:20,053
out which parts are biological, and which
are social because from the standpoint of

79
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:25,079
common sense, it is all biological. Most
people who are not educated in sociology

80
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:31,097
see these differences as rooted in nature.
A few years ago, the president of Harvard,

81
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:36,082
Larry Summers made a deliberately
provocative statement, for which he later

82
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:41,087
apologized, Suggesting that the existence
of fewer women in science might have

83
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:46,040
something to do with there being fewer
women at the higher end of the

84
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,064
intelligence distribution as measured by
IQ scores. He was trying to suggest that

85
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:56,063
there was something innate or natural
about this outcome. Now, once we know that

86
00:07:56,063 --> 00:08:01,045
there is a strong social component to male
and female. We may hope that there are

87
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:06,003
things that we can do to influence the
environment that may actually have an

88
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:10,031
impact on the long term outcomes of men
and women. We know that there is

89
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:15,018
significant amount of gender inequality
even in the United States today A country

90
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:19,035
that has been thinking about these
differences longer than some other

91
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:23,075
countries. And at the same time we find
that many of these differences are

92
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:27,096
intractable, or very difficult to
eradicate. But to come back to the

93
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:33,028
statement by the president of Harvard,
there's actually been some progress in

94
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:38,046
getting more women into fields like
biological scientists. Summers' remarks

95
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:43,037
ignored some very important data. In 1966,
less than one percent of U.S. Doctoral

96
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:48,089
degrees in engineering were awarded to
women. While in 2001, the number had risen

97
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,028
to about seventeen%. Surely the IQ of
women at the high end of the distribution

98
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:59,079
didn't change. Not significantly during
this period. These numbers suggest that a

99
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,099
lot of progress still needs to be made.
Some of our institutions in American

100
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:10,074
society are working very hard to ask what
we can do to change gender inequality and

101
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:16,015
to change the sense of how it is natural
for man and women to behave or act in

102
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:20,098
particular ways. In math and science
training, a vast amount of sociological

103
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:26,016
research has demonstrated that when teach
ers or parents have low expectations for

104
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:31,035
girls then women will not develop their
potential talents. We know that for a very

105
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:36,047
long time in universities like Princeton
there were very few women who went into

106
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:41,072
science and engineering And it was a sense
on the part of many women who went into

107
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:46,065
these universities that is was a male
thing to do. This view is something that

108
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:52,035
was encouraged in the earliest stage of
life. Over time expectations have changed.

109
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:57,026
We have more and more women going into
science and engineering, but these are

110
00:09:57,026 --> 00:10:02,036
things that the university knows begin
with a pipeline. They can only be changed

111
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:07,059
if the stereotypes and the sense of what
is appropriate and natural for different

112
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:13,001
genders to take on changes at the earliest
parts of life. Coinciding perhaps with the

113
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:18,092
very moment when we are starting to
interact with children in gendered ways or

114
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:25,013
let's take an even more controversial
example, racial differences in IQ.

115
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,075
Sometimes when white people find out that
I'm a sociologist they'll ask why it is

116
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:36,017
that blacks are doing worst than whites in
the United States And it's not uncommon

117
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:41,034
for folks to suggest to me that it is
because they're not as smart. And they'll

118
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:46,050
cite evidence that blacks have lower IQ
scores in general. Quote, they're not as

119
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:52,061
smart so they don't do as well, right? Now
it is true that blacks have lower IQ

120
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:57,076
scores In general, than whites in the
United States. People, who argue this,

121
00:10:57,076 --> 00:11:03,019
argue that it's based on genetics. One
explanation is that they have smaller

122
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:08,047
brains than whites. But that is wrong. In
his book "Intelligence and how to get it,"

123
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:14,008
Richard Nesbitt says that Albert Einstein
had a smaller brain than the average black

124
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:19,089
person. Brain size is not the cause of
these differences. There's also the claim

125
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,092
that these lower IQ's are inherited. Well,
there are many studies that have been done

126
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:29,041
that have demonstrated. The ways that IQ,
is also based on the environmental

127
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:34,028
influences The social context, in which
people live. Thus, according to Nisbit,

128
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:40,004
the average child in a poor family will
hear substantially fewer words, per day,

129
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:45,057
then someone in an upper middle class
family. By a time a child reaches five

130
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:50,082
years old, he or she will hear many more
words in a higher income family.

131
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:56,028
Vocabulary, it turns out, is a very
significant determinant of how people do

132
00:11:56,028 --> 00:12:01,057
on IQ tests. According to Nisbit, the
average IQ in the United States over the

133
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:06,062
course of the past 50 years since World
War [inaudible] has gone up fifteen to

134
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:11,029
twenty points. That is just the average
for Americans, as a whole And it's

135
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:16,079
impossible for the genetics of the country
to have changed that much over the past 50

136
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,032
years. So we know that there is something
about the environment of the United States

137
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:27,065
that is affecting the group as a whole And
during this period, the average difference

138
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:32,073
in IQ between blacks and whites decreased
significantly. It was fifteen points in

139
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:37,087
1945 and its nine points today. According
to Nisbit, that corresponds to a certain

140
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:42,007
level of improvement in the black
population, compared to the white

141
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:47,062
population, in their standard of living.
The average lack today has a higher IQ

142
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:53,042
than the average white in 1950, another
interesting thing to explain. So these are

143
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:59,050
some examples of how it is that one of the
great achievements of the social sciences

144
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,072
and thinking about IQ has been to
understand the way that many things we

145
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:10,023
take to be natural are not completely
based on genetics but are themselves a

146
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,074
function of the social environment
