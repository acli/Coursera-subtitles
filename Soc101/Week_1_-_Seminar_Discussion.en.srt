00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,001
Greetings everyone and welcome to the
first session, our first live session of

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:11,005
Introduction to Sociology. The last few
days have been simply extraordinary in

3
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:17,002
terms of the response and the discussion,
on the course website which I've been

4
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:22,001
following. Although I have not been able
to respond, to each and everyone of your

5
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:26,009
postings, I want you to know that I've
been looking carefully at the many things

6
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:32,005
that you have written and I am so
impressed with the level and quality of

7
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:36,006
the discussion and the ways in which you
are all helping one another along to

8
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:41,007
develop a better understanding of the
material. This is peer learning at its

9
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:47,006
best and this a very impressive group of
students from all over the world. I want

10
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:54,000
to begin today by thanking my own
administration. The President and the

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,062
provost, and the Dean of the faculty and
the Dean of the college, and the Associate

12
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:03,007
Dean, and the people at the McGraw
Teaching Center, and the people working

13
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:08,001
here in the broadcast center at Princeton
University for making all of this

14
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:15,006
possible. It's this university's
commitment to bringing courses like this

15
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:22,003
to a wider public and being inclusive that
has made this possible and their decision

16
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:28,006
to devote the resources to this kind of
enterprise makes, me feel wonderful as a

17
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:33,009
member of the Princeton faculty and I know
that my colleagues on the Princeton

18
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:40,005
faculty feel as though very similarly to
me that this is a very special moment in

19
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:46,003
the history of higher education that we
are a part of, that we have the privilege

20
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:50,071
of being a part of. And, I want to say
also that, you know, this is really part

21
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:58,002
of a pretty long standing tradition here
at Princeton. In our university we have a

22
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:02,003
very generous financial aide package to
students who come here from a very wide

23
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:08,003
variety of backgrounds. And one of the
things that I think didn't come across in

24
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:14,004
the article by Malcolm Gladwell is the
extent to which that is significant on the

25
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:22,000
ongoing life of Princeton. We have
certainly the best financial aid package

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,006
in the world and it is something that we
ar e very proud of. Probably 60 percent of

27
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:33,007
our students are on financial aid. Our
students are not required to take out

28
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:38,009
loans to come here. The financial aid is
available to students not only from the

29
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:44,009
United States but from all over the world.
And that extends to $5,000 to $50,000

30
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:50,002
depending on the needs of an individual
family in a given year and I have received

31
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:54,007
questions over e-mail for students around
the world asking whether or not, it's

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,078
possible for people from outside the
United States to apply for financially

33
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:02,009
aid. And the answer is yes, there are no
limitations on that and financial need is

34
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:09,000
not taking into consideration when
admissions decisions are made. Over ten

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,002
percent of our student body comes from
outside the United States and many of

36
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:19,007
those students are on financial aid. I
want to talk today about the Malcolm

37
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:27,006
Gladwell article but first I want to begin
by discussing in some detail. The article

38
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:33,009
that we read by C. Wright Mills which was
written of course in 1959. And I want to

39
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:38,007
begin by welcoming the students from
around the world who are part of our

40
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:43,003
seminar for today. I should say at the
outset that we invited a couple of more

41
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:47,000
people to join us today and for technical
reasons, some of them are not up on the

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,008
screen, they might pop up during the
course of our conversation. But for the

43
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:55,000
time being, we are going to speak with the
people that are there. I'd like them to

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,071
introduce themselves to us beginning with
the person on the far left, Dipendra. And

45
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:05,005
then let's go to each person and I'd like
the each of you to say something about

46
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:10,024
what you thought was most interesting,
something brief about what you thought was

47
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:16,068
most interesting about Mills's essay, The
promise. Dipendra. >> Hi, this is Di,

48
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:24,052
Nepal. And if you are wondering where
Nepal is we are in, India, a small

49
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:32,089
country, country. I come from, my
bachelors in rural development and I have

50
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:40,041
a major in sociology as well. Particular
interested in, in this, today's lecture by

51
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:46,087
C. Wright Mills. I've been very much
fascinated for those examples of study

52
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:54,085
relating to the institution of the society
specifically at his out during the lecture

53
00:04:54,085 --> 00:05:00,056
regarding divorce and marriage. That was
one thing very much interesting to me.

54
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:08,060
Another thing we tried, the last, the text
which is that if you want to develop your

55
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:16,086
socialism then you should plays very, mean
. So, that, about the thing that have been

56
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:22,087
striking ... >> Okay. Dipendra
unfortunately the connection to you was

57
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:28,012
not great and but I will summarize though
that you thought that the, one of the most

58
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:33,004
interesting things has to do with the
connection of the sociological imagination

59
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:39,036
to marriage and divorce. And, we will look
forward to hearing more from you later

60
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:45,070
hopefully with a better connection. Doug?
>> Yeah, hi. I'm Doug, I'm from

61
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:52,074
Philadelphia. I, I don't know. I, The
Promise I believe is the name of the

62
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:57,041
paper. My impression, it was really hard
to understand you know, trying to put

63
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:02,007
myself back in 1959 and trying to
understand where it was coming from. It

64
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:08,005
seemed almost like you're just trying to
focus on the psychology I guess of being

65
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:14,041
trapped. But I also want, I, I did
understand the basic thing of where I was

66
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:18,033
going with it. >> Doug, could you tell us
a little bit about yourself in

67
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:23,058
Philadelphia. >> Yeah, I'm a firefighter
in Philadelphia. 34 years old which I

68
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:31,007
think makes me the oldest member of the
panel. I you know, I took a little bit of

69
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:37,036
college. After high school I was in the
Navy most of the time. And now I'm trying

70
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:41,072
to get back in college. >> And are you,
are you talking to us from the firehouse

71
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:47,000
right now? >> No. No, I can't. >> [laugh]
>> I can't do that. [laugh] . >> [laugh]

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,004
>> All that I say is what my opinion, it
has nothing to do with the Fire

73
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:55,007
Department. But no, I'm at my house and
yeah, I'm excited to hear. >> Okay. Thank

74
00:06:55,007 --> 00:07:03,008
you, Doug. >> My name is Estela Diaz. I'm
a Princeton University student majoring in

75
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:09,073
Sociology. I'm originally from Los
Angeles, California and currently livin g

76
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:16,002
in Spanish Harlem in New York City. One of
the things I thought was most interesting

77
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:21,009
is considering the sociological
imagination in context of the United

78
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:29,000
States 2012 political campaign and the
presidential election. I'm just kind of

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,076
considering how issues are framed. Whether
they are framed as, personal issues or

80
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:45,075
public issues specially the economic
downturn. >> Fascinating. Is it Nana who's

81
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:54,091
next? >> I'm Nana. I'm from Georgia. It's
Caucasus not Georgia in USA. >> [laugh].

82
00:07:54,091 --> 00:08:01,040
>> I am working as a representative of
Israeli delegation here in Georgia and

83
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:09,008
Ukraine and in Belarus. Also I have a
travel company with my friend. We're

84
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:18,063
dealing with the incoming tourists and for
me the most I pay attention on the

85
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:26,026
sociological imagination check through
one, it was quite interesting for me how

86
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:34,072
people can imagine the scenes in word and
also marriage and divorce because in

87
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:44,003
Georgia it's quite complicated. >> Thank
you, Nana. And then finally. >> Hello, my

88
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:50,059
name is [inaudible] University School of
[inaudible] and National Relations which

89
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:58,036
is the case in Southwestern Russia. I
found this article very interesting

90
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:09,043
because it's effect that's a lot just a
moment in terms of historical change and

91
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:20,005
even the so we have to, to think more, to
think wider in this case. >> That's very

92
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:25,059
interesting. Okay, well, these are some
very interesting ways of beginning our

93
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:30,096
thinking about what Mills was trying to
say and what I'd like to do now with you

94
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:36,062
guys is to try to go through the essay in
a little bit of detail from Kathmandu, to

95
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:43,036
Siberia, to Georgia, to Spanish Harlem, to
Philadelphia and talk about the meaning of

96
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:48,083
some of these lines and how we should
interpret them. I want to begin with the

97
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:53,080
first paragraph, the second line where
Mills says, they sensed that within their

98
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:00,024
everyday world, they cannot overcome their
troubles and this feel, and this feeling

99
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:05,084
they are quite often correct. One question
that I want to ask you is this, is, is

100
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:11,069
there some sense in which t hat line and
the essay as a whole gives the impression,

101
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:17,085
gives an impression to people that if only
they can develop a sociological

102
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:25,065
imagination, that they can overcome their
troubles. And is that really realistic?

103
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:34,044
What are some of the dilemmas involved in
thinking about this in such a way? >>

104
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:40,049
Yeah. I believe that was something that
had, something to do a little bit more of

105
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:46,001
this psychology of it you know, somebody
that's kinda trapped in their own.

106
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:50,057
Sometimes made up show is because they
feel, I mean it's almost like looking at

107
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:55,048
this you know, I was never able, I wasn't
much of a person that was very come out in

108
00:10:55,048 --> 00:11:02,017
high school I guess so I didn't take the
college route. And when as I got older, I

109
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:07,017
wanted to go to college but now this is
forwarding opportunity. I feel like I'm

110
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:10,075
widening now a little bit like from
personal experience so that's kinda like

111
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:16,016
the way I look at it like. Instead of me
sentencing that within my own shell, now I

112
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:21,089
feel like I'm just through this course.
I'm feeling like I'm kind of getting over

113
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:27,001
it. >> And, and is there a sense though I,
I, I'm curious to know in which, does

114
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:32,045
having a sociological imagination give us
any legitimate reason to believe that we

115
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:39,049
are in a better position to overcome our
personal troubles? Or is that, is that an

116
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:47,034
unrealistic kind of thing to begin, to
begin the essay with? >> I didn't

117
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:55,053
personally interpret it as such instead I
interpreted this repeated notion of not

118
00:11:55,053 --> 00:12:03,043
being able to overcome one's personal
troubles. I interpreted that as Mills is

119
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:10,080
arguing for a larger perspective not
necessarily saying that having a

120
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:17,077
sociological imagination will allow you to
overcome troubles but instead emphasizing

121
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:25,042
that our troubles are not strictly derived
from the individual. So Mills is arguing

122
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:32,077
that having sociological imagination will
give you a different perspective on your

123
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:39,052
troubles but it will not necessarily solve
your troubles. >> Very interesting. Would

124
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:47,035
anyone else like to comment on this? >> I
think almost the same because I, I think

125
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:54,054
it's not d epend to overcome troubles.
It's, it's not coming from the

126
00:12:54,054 --> 00:13:02,003
sociological imagination, you can you can
solve your troubles and solve your

127
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:09,008
problems without knowing it but it helps
you quite a lot. >> And, but are you sure

128
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:14,000
about that, Norma? Are you really sure
that having the sociological imagination

129
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,062
would help you in solving the personal
troubles? >> No. Like in your day dream.

130
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:28,079
>> Oh, really? Could you say more about
that? >> Like say in Georgia if, if you're

131
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:40,001
like for people who are coming from
abroad, it's, it's not easy to find some

132
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:45,015
jobs. If you are not an investor it's not
easy to find it. If you know the

133
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:54,020
sociological imagination like to help the,
the, help people, how people think about

134
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,055
it, you will not come in Georgia and start
your work here. You will go to another

135
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:03,086
country to find some job. Let's say, let's
say this example. >> So, in other words,

136
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:08,045
having the socio, that's a really good
answer. Having the sociological

137
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:13,066
imagination is going to perhaps one way of
having a sociological imagination is to

138
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:19,008
know our probabilities and understanding
the probabilities means that we can access

139
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:24,075
our chances and decide what we should try
and what we shouldn't try, right? >> Yeah.

140
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:30,064
>> Okay. But let me ask you a question
Estela. You're a Princeton student, okay?

141
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:34,046
>> If you knew. >> Mm-hm. >> The
probabilities when you applied to

142
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:41,028
Princeton, of being accepted, would you
have ever tried? >> I mean, I think kind

143
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:48,059
of did know the probabilities with less
than ten percent acceptance rate. And

144
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:56,033
over, I think it's, it was about 30,000
people who applied, higher, with only,

145
00:14:56,033 --> 00:15:05,091
with less than 2,000 of us being accepted,
the probability was extremely low. But you

146
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:13,037
have to, in, in case, in the case of
applying to Princeton University, I think

147
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:19,004
there was something worth a lot more than,
I think it was worth taking my chances. >>

148
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:24,002
But the thing is, is just, did having a
sociological imagination and knowing the

149
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:29,062
odds, did that increases the chance of you
applying or don't you think that there are

150
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,093
some people w ho are having that knowledge
might have said, it's not worth it to try

151
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:38,064
at all. I mean, if somebody to finds out
that, that the chances of, the chances of

152
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:43,089
doing, of succeeding in any fields are
small, does that knowledge necessarily

153
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:48,060
help them in the end? We assume, we're,
we're assuming that it's empowering to

154
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,091
have that knowledge but I wonder if it
could also be disempowering. >> I think I

155
00:15:53,091 --> 00:16:02,062
could. >> Go ahead. >> It could certainly
be discouraging specially if you consider

156
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:10,001
Mills article in general, he's kind of
taking away from the notion of individual

157
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:18,066
agency and individual power. So when you
take that away, it does and can seem very

158
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:27,087
discouraging. >> Doug, what do you think
about this? >> Well, basically I, I think

159
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:33,084
that Estela could nail it on the head. The
you know, that sense of you know, when

160
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:38,063
like things are hopeless, people are going
to say, why am I gonna put the effort in?

161
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:44,011
But, if you realize like Estela did that
you know, that doesn't just define who you

162
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:48,046
are that, that you know, that ten%, if
you're going to borrow that ten%, you're

163
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:52,075
part of that ten percent like what are you
going to do about it? It is what it is and

164
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:57,008
that really, I think that could really be
freeing for somebody because that's not

165
00:16:57,008 --> 00:17:01,021
going to really upset them if they turn
around and get rejected. They'll say,

166
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:05,097
okay, whatever, you know, although I was
ready for that. It's kinda like a you

167
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:11,031
know, expect the, expect the worst or hope
for the best and expect the worst kind of

168
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:15,099
thing, I guess. And I don't know if I am
missing that point. >> Let's move on to

169
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:21,063
the next to the next part of the paper. At
the very beginning of the second

170
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:26,073
paragraph, Mills says, underlying the
sense of being trapped are seemingly

171
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:32,091
impersonal changes the very structure of
continent wide societies. There were some

172
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:39,029
discussion on the discussion boards over
the last few days about what Mills meant

173
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:45,075
by impersonal changes. And I thought that
you guys did a very good job of clarifying

174
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:50,063
the issue for those who were confused but,
what does this mean to you? What are some

175
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:55,035
of the kinds of impersonal changes that
affect you in the society in which you

176
00:17:55,035 --> 00:18:02,035
live as a way of conceiving of what Mills
is talking about. Dipendra, could you

177
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:10,034
start? >> In, in, I was very much
interested in the previous paragraph so I

178
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:14,021
was about to speak but I lost my
connection. So, maybe I would rather go

179
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:19,004
back to that paragraph and I'll resume to
this paragraph at the end. >> Sure, why

180
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:23,059
don't you do that. >> So, in the previous
thing. >> Go ahead, please do. >> So, I

181
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:29,030
have a different I have a, I have a
different perspective on that it does say,

182
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:37,032
it is said that within the everyday works
they cannot overcome the troubles. I want

183
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:44,079
to keep myself in this example. I have my
parents divorced. So in this actually when

184
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:50,065
my parents, then was suddenly, the problem
that I'm facing in the world. So, I,

185
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:57,009
believe is facing this kind of problem and
I was so I have a small sister and I have

186
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:02,044
my mom crying in front of me everyday and
my dad, dad was with another woman. So,

187
00:19:02,044 --> 00:19:08,068
how I felt, it was like I felt that this
was only me. This is only, I'm the guy

188
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:15,099
problem. But sociological imagination, I
think that in a broader perspective, when

189
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:24,021
I look at my society then I see a lot of
people who get who get divorced so then,

190
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:31,034
then I do is, I simply hiding myself and
say that, okay boy, this is, this is not

191
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:36,070
only the way you move ahead. It's not,
spend your whole life regretting because

192
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,061
your dad married to another woman or
something. So, where, and I look at only

193
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:47,059
when I think back is my problem only and I
feel I'm trapped in that problem. But when

194
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:53,029
I come out of my family, when I come out,
when I look at my society then I feel a

195
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:58,075
lot, this is the broader perspective that
I should look into and that, that is, that

196
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:02,090
really motivated me. >> Well, I think
that, that is a really wonderful statement

197
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:08,084
because what you're saying is that you
feel as though the understanding that your

198
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:15,002
experience was not a personal problem but
was part of a larger trend and a larger

199
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:19,096
public issue inspired you to feel
empowered. And that you decided that you

200
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:24,086
are going to rise above your social
circumstances with that knowledge knowing

201
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:30,013
that was not your fault or knowing that
this was not the fault of your, your

202
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:36,065
family and I actually, I think that's a
really excellent response to my concern

203
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:40,090
and it's, it's really a nice response
because I think that in the case of

204
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,026
divorce, it's true that many children feel
as though they are themselves the cause of

205
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:49,069
their parents divorce so they feel as
though they are responsible for it and

206
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:54,077
certainly it's true that the family
members blame themselves and I think it's,

207
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:59,022
it is the case that if you know that
you're part of something larger and wider,

208
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:06,019
perhaps that is actually empowering. To be
able to get beyond it and move beyond it.

209
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:13,001
And yet I must tell you that I feel still
nevertheless a certain concern over these

210
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:19,004
lines and what they imply in the essay
because for many people, you know, their

211
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:25,000
lives are just really hard. And, it is
going to be hard for them whether they

212
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,004
know that they're part of a larger social
trend or not. And the ability to rise

213
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:37,002
beyond their social, social circumstances,
I worry takes a lot more obviously than

214
00:21:37,002 --> 00:21:43,098
any kind of knowledge or understanding of
this kind but perhaps that's just, that's

215
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:55,013
just obvious and not worth being overly,
overly concerned with. By the way in our

216
00:21:55,013 --> 00:22:00,014
Princeton Seminars, there are moments as
Estela will tell you, of complete silence.

217
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:05,011
And I encourage those moments in my
seminar I believe in silence. I think it's

218
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:09,043
great for people to be able to sit and
think for a second. Sometimes we'll have

219
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:15,028
silence for 30 seconds in the room before
somebody talks. We shouldn't always feel

220
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:21,019
pressure to fill in every gap at every
moment and no more so just because we

221
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:25,087
happen to be on the Internet for 30,000
other students right now. Does anybody

222
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:30,056
else have anything they wanted to add to
that before we move on there, then. >>

223
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:37,084
Yes. May I add something. It will be kind
of question. Wh en, when you are talking

224
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:43,094
in your lecture about sociological
imagination, we find that marriage and

225
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:51,063
divorce, situations and issues, I remember
the words of Soviets secrets General

226
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:58,045
Joseph Stalin cuz he once said to Averill
Harriman he said, the death if one man is

227
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:04,002
a tragedy, the death of million is
statistic. I'd like to know the terminals

228
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:10,062
of General Joseph Stalin and happen he was
a dictator. That was just the first thing

229
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:18,068
that came to my mind. Whether there is an
argument whether he said it or not. So I

230
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:29,069
wanted to ask a bit political question. He
said that in terms of historical change

231
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:40,009
has also Mills noted. Our lives are only a
moment so today anything around us could

232
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:49,074
be revealed as statistic even our lives
can be statistic within this cope of the

233
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:59,024
population size and then the scope of many
other issues. So our president tells about

234
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:07,075
radius. When he tells about radius, he
sites average which is data. Why doesn't

235
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:18,038
he site the lowest, for example Tatiana
who is which a school teacher in Siberia

236
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:25,065
in who has four children and tries to
survive the four kids. How do you think

237
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:34,014
professor? Can the government treat its
people just as a statistic? And where is

238
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:41,074
the border of statistic and the real life?
>> Well, I think that it's very tempting

239
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:47,064
to use a single statistic and of course
what a sociological imagination is going

240
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:54,006
to do, is going to try to encourage people
to look at the variation. And to try to

241
00:24:54,006 --> 00:25:02,004
explain the variation in a society. And, I
think that there's always a tendency to

242
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:06,004
try to put the focus in one place or the
other but your job is as the sociologist

243
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:11,009
is to move toward and understanding and
grasping of that variation in which you

244
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:17,003
just did in your wonderful comment and
that's a great quote which I'm sure that

245
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:25,003
I'll be using in the future when I give
this lecture again. I want to ask you guys

246
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:30,032
to take a peek though at the notion of
that first line in the essay and I want to

247
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:37,083
get back to this issue of impersonal
changes. Could you guys try to think about

248
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:43,064
what that means and try to help the
students who were concerned about that all

249
00:25:43,064 --> 00:25:49,008
on the website to reflect on that a little
bit more. What are some of the impersonal

250
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:57,002
changes in, in your society? Nana has gone
off, why do we go to Doug? >> When I look

251
00:25:57,002 --> 00:26:01,007
at these line as far as impersonal
changes, I felt like that was something

252
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:06,001
that, you know, in an, in an, in a time, I
mean, it was brought up before about

253
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:10,060
what's going on with the housing crisis,
with the job crisis and everything else.

254
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,004
And at the time when jobs are, you know,
so you know, far between, somebody can

255
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:19,005
very easily think for themselves whether
there's something wrong with me that's why

256
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:23,070
I'm not working. Then, if they look at
the, you know, the way that everything is

257
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,053
in the society, it's not a, it's not a
personal change that you need to make it's

258
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:31,071
the way that the society is that, you
know, that the, the structure and as it

259
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:37,053
go, the very structure of the kind of wide
society that if there's, there's change

260
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:43,011
made to the system you know, not something
that has to do with this one person like I

261
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:46,069
feel like that line is trying to give
somebody a little bit of hope you know,

262
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:49,099
like look it's not you, you have the
ability, you just need to understand it.

263
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:53,031
If there's a problem out there right now,
I think we're just going to need to try a

264
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:57,050
little bit harder and don't let yourself
down and don't feel like you're trapped.

265
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:06,064
>> Okay. Estela? >> No, I think he saw
that very well. I'm trying to think. I'm

266
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:15,028
looking at what he says the structure of
continent wide societies and just

267
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:21,051
contextualizing this in nineteen, I mean,
if we consider the effect of the Internet

268
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:27,069
now in our very discussion here today, we
were discussing that's what people on

269
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:35,060
various continent and greatest countries.
So looking at impersonal changes that's

270
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:43,083
something far beyond our, what he says as
personal, personal troubles. >> Yeah. I

271
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:50,055
think that one of the things that, that
concerns me about this point as well is

272
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:56,044
that, you know, the emphasis on obviously
the impersonal changes and that as if they

273
00:27:56,044 --> 00:28:02,076
are always trapping us. And I think that
we have to have more neurons to view of it

274
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:08,036
at least I would propose that and the you
know, you know, the impersonal change of

275
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:13,079
today, today of the Internet obviously is
also leading to possibilities like the one

276
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:19,008
that we have before us right now. And, I
think that our job as a sociologist is to

277
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:24,028
look at the ways in which impersonal
changes not only trap us, but also

278
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:31,059
liberate us and potentially make us more
free. And I wonder whether or not anybody

279
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:36,002
could present an example other than the
Internet of any kind of impersonal change

280
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:40,090
in their own society. Or perhaps the
internet is the best one for your society

281
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:46,074
right now that you'd like to refer to.
But, in which the actual impersonal change

282
00:28:46,074 --> 00:29:05,043
has been liberating rather than simply
constraining. Remember silence is fine.

283
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:25,097
Silence is good in the seminar. Everyone
can think. >> I think that was a good

284
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:34,056
example, try to recover other issues. >>
Okay. Well maybe we can ask our online

285
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:40,095
viewers. The other members of the class to
think about that issue a little bit as we

286
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:48,039
move forward in the class. I want to move
on now to a discussion of the New Yorker

287
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:54,034
article that was written by the great
writer the great non-fiction writer,

288
00:29:54,034 --> 00:30:00,037
Malcolm Gladwell. And I, I saw some
questions on the discussion boards about

289
00:30:00,037 --> 00:30:08,000
why I would have assigned this article for
the first class. And in fact, the article

290
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,045
was assigned for exactly the reason that
many of you proposed in your answers to

291
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:19,057
the person who asked that question because
I believe it exemplifies the sociological

292
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:26,036
imagination. Can you guys hear me right
now? Yes? Okay, good. So, let's begin now

293
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:33,090
by talking a little bit about Gladwell's
article. Gladwell being a Canadian who

294
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:39,019
came to the United States and was kind of
intrigued by the culture of New York City

295
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:44,055
in which he found that there were many p
eople who are obsessed with Harvard in

296
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:50,050
particular and the, and who seemed to
think that if they had gone there that

297
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:55,063
there was nothing greater, of greater
importance that could have happened to

298
00:30:55,063 --> 00:31:00,070
them in their, in their lives. And he
wrote this essay based on the, as we know,

299
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:07,040
based on the research of sociologist
Jerome Karabel largely about the, the,

300
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:16,002
the, the, the nature of admissions at, at
Harvard, Princeton and Yale and the way in

301
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:21,019
which it moved in the direction that it is
in today. And, one of the things that I

302
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:27,083
found very interesting about the responses
on the Internet to this was that, there

303
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:34,051
were many people who saw the, the decision
of the Ivy League Schools to look at the

304
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:39,096
whole person rather than a single
dimension as meaning, as implying that,

305
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:45,046
that, that was somehow a false promise of
that they, or that, that, that people who

306
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:50,063
have been excluded that people, that they
themselves were being promised something

307
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:57,055
that wasn't really fair or obtainable when
they were giving the, the, the hope that

308
00:31:57,055 --> 00:32:03,019
they one day could achieve or go to an Ivy
League School. And I'm just curious about

309
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:08,022
that response because my own feeling about
it in looking at the way that the system

310
00:32:08,022 --> 00:32:13,010
of college admissions emerged is that
well, I think it's good that the largest

311
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,095
group of students in the university has
gotten there because of their academic

312
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:23,022
achievement. I think that it is also true
that there are so many other qualities in

313
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:28,019
life that make for a deserving and an
interesting human being. And, would we

314
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:34,014
really want a college to only include the
people who have the highest scores rather

315
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:40,014
than a system like the ones, the one that
has been designed which actually looks at

316
00:32:40,014 --> 00:32:44,052
a much wider variety of personal
characteristics. And I'm just curious

317
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:50,022
about what your response was to some of
those comments and how you would design a

318
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:58,008
system like this if it was to you?
Dipendra. >> Actually when I was going

319
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:03,052
through this lecture, what I've heard was
the education system the admission system

320
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:10,002
that was there and unfortunately, in
Nepal, I've been practicing that now. So,

321
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:16,060
we have the, actually a brief background
of the, the admission system that we have

322
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:22,074
here and then I'll, I'll get back to my
point. So, here at Nepal, what was there

323
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:27,059
are typically two different kinds of
colleges or universities. The [inaudible]

324
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:32,040
all the university and all the college
here in Nepal is you should get at least

325
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,089
good master. At least, [inaudible] more
than 60 percent or more than three GPA so

326
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:43,026
that you can get into good college or
something like that. And very few very few

327
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:50,046
colleges and universities we have in hands
or fingers that they look overall student

328
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:56,058
or they look at overall characteristics of
students. So it would depend, but I would

329
00:33:56,058 --> 00:34:03,014
like to say seeing, look at examples that
I have seen here in Nepal, what I have

330
00:34:03,014 --> 00:34:08,094
come to conclude is typically, there are
two different university here that I would

331
00:34:08,094 --> 00:34:13,054
like to mention in Nepal. The Tribhuvan
University which is government owned

332
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:18,026
university and Kathmandu University that
is privately owned university. So, why

333
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:24,027
does Tribhuvan University does? They don't
have a proper definite system of being in

334
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:29,051
students. So, every time they have it,
they get admission in that college. They

335
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:34,021
have let's say you have grossed 50 percent
then you'll get into that university and

336
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:40,019
where I am now. And before, before coming
to this university, I actually drop the

337
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:45,085
Kathmandu University because private
university and the, which required regal

338
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:52,097
competition. They had they had added a
baseline for academics. We need to get at

339
00:34:52,097 --> 00:34:58,000
least 60 percent in your high school then
you, you should be astounding in extra

340
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,054
curricular activities, you should be
astounding in sports, you should be social

341
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:08,009
and so, so many characteristics. And
where, where the products that come out

342
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:14,047
after, in the universities after four
years, we can see a clear distinction here

343
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:21,039
in Nepal. Kathmandu University which have,
which have the syste m of looking student

344
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:27,006
from all dimension, the, the students are,
are, they are very practical then a lot of

345
00:35:27,006 --> 00:35:33,076
them, you know, they are outgoing and
while we look at the students of Tribhuvan

346
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:39,009
University, what I see is students are
very much confined to books or not in, not

347
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:45,031
even in textbooks, we have just papers
here. That means the questions that, the

348
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:49,093
exams. So there are some predicted
questions and you go through that question

349
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:58,011
and you won't get questions out of that.
It is, sometimes that's really a very

350
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:05,078
difficult Tribhuvan University. So, what I
did is college student to get some

351
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:12,040
academics would be one of the primary
criteria. But we should have salute

352
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:18,053
students in overall how good they meddle
in society. How a good in this course. >>

353
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:23,081
Thank you. Thank you for that interesting
comment, Dipendra. Would anyone else like

354
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:28,083
to comment on this? >> Yes, may I comment.
>> Yes. >> Because getting in is a very

355
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:35,035
present problem for me and now I'm
graduating in a few days and then I'll be

356
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:42,090
I have to find educate masters program.
And while I was reading, getting in

357
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:50,019
article, I, I have a feeling you know,
well, the situation that existed in the

358
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:58,030
beginning of the twentieth Century in
Harvard University and Yale etc. With

359
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:07,022
standardized this now exists in Russia, in
the twenty-first Century, in the beginning

360
00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:14,068
of twenty-first Century. So, I think it's
not a good way to admit students just on

361
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:26,096
the basis of standardized tests. Academic
records is a very is, is an important

362
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:39,079
problem but, but while admitting they
should see they should see the person

363
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:50,001
hopeless and hopeless and hope, he's
begral, he's experienced. What he can do

364
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:57,021
maybe just melt on the, his studies. >>
So, it's interesting to hear your

365
00:37:57,021 --> 00:38:02,005
perspectives on this and it is true that
outside the United States that the

366
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:09,010
standards are usually much more narrow for
admissions decisions. And I think that,

367
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:15,020
that is what accounted for some of the
surprise that initially came on to the

368
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:20,042
site about the way that it's done here in
the United States. I want to, oh, I see we

369
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:25,066
have another person that just joined us.
Another Princeton student named Dickson

370
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:31,063
Lee. Hi, Dickson. >> Hi, Mitch. >> So,
we're talking right now about the Malcolm

371
00:38:31,063 --> 00:38:38,030
Gladwell essay and one of the interesting
points that I want to sort of end by

372
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:43,055
thinking about, is something that came up
a lot on the discussion boards which was

373
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:48,081
the study that was cited and this is for
everybody, not just for Dickson. The study

374
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:55,071
that was cited by Gladwell, by my
colleague Alan Krueger, who did a study of

375
00:38:55,071 --> 00:39:01,015
the people who were let's say,
hypothetically, as it's described in the

376
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:06,044
article, accepted into a state university
like Penn State, at a private university

377
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:12,041
like the University of Pennsylvania. And
what was his point in making that

378
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:19,057
comparison and what did he find. Does
anybody remember? It certainly listed on a

379
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:26,040
lot of response on the, the discussion
board. So they referred to it as comparing

380
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:34,023
apples to apples. And what they discovered
is that both, both the person who decides

381
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:42,001
to go to more elite university, "elites",
and the person who decides to go to state

382
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:49,041
school, both do well in the future. With
the finding of one exemption which is

383
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:57,019
those from the lowest economic strata.
Those from this strata were seen as

384
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:05,004
benefiting from the elite's education. And
it didn't say, it didn't explained this in

385
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:10,009
anyway but that was the finding. >> Can
anybody explain, thank you Estela. Can

386
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:15,079
anybody explain to us what was the logic
of the article. He used the word selection

387
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:22,047
and treatment and what was the exact way
in which he went about doing study in

388
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:30,064
which those words became so important.
What was he measuring? What was he

389
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:37,094
comparing? Does anybody have any memory of
that aspect of the article? What was

390
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:47,045
Krueger doing there? In the traditional,
it's just to jog your memory, in the

391
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:53,031
traditional measures of the impact of an
Ivy League educati on, comparisons have

392
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:59,065
been made between the salaries of people
who graduated from Ivy League Schools and

393
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:06,009
the salaries of people who graduated from
other schools and what Kruger said was,

394
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:12,078
let's change the comparison. Instead of
comparing it in that way, how did we do

395
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:23,035
it? He compared the people who were the
same person. He only took people who were

396
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:27,093
graduated, who admitted both to private
schools, to Ivy League Schools and to

397
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:32,048
other schools and who chose for some
reason, to go to the other school instead.

398
00:41:32,048 --> 00:41:37,027
And he compared those same people against
the average people who came out of Ivy

399
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:42,035
League Schools and he found out that those
people actually did just as well as the

400
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:47,034
people who went to Ivy League Schools. And
so his point was, that it was not

401
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:53,028
necessarily the treatment of going to an
Ivy League School that matter, in terms of

402
00:41:53,028 --> 00:42:00,043
the success of people but it was instead
the, the, the selection into the system

403
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:05,008
from the very beginning of certain kinds
of people that were destined to be

404
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:10,008
successful. And he basically, despite the
fact that he's a Princeton professor and

405
00:42:10,008 --> 00:42:16,005
have, has every reason to be biased in
favor of the Ivy League, he concluded that

406
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:22,001
the impact of the Ivy League is not nearly
as great as it's taken to be by the wider

407
00:42:22,001 --> 00:42:28,050
society and the wider world. Now it seems
to me that kind of analysis that Krueger

408
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:33,021
did, is in the best tradition of the
sociological imagination. And it seems to

409
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:38,007
me that, that kind of information should
be empowering to many people regardless of

410
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:44,091
whether or not they would even want to
come to Princeton or some other Ivy League

411
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:50,074
School. Did you guys did that, did that
information make a similar impression on

412
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:55,087
you guys? What effect did it have on you
to read that part of the article? >> Yeah,

413
00:42:55,087 --> 00:43:04,032
it's understood. Yeah, I understand what
you're saying. The, the, the one, the one

414
00:43:04,032 --> 00:43:09,071
quote that he has here is having pen on
your resume opens doors. And I do notice

415
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:14,078
that there is that sort of the meanest
attitude when it comes to society in

416
00:43:14,078 --> 00:43:18,081
general. People turn and mayb e look at
certain people or certain kind of way and

417
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:22,041
to put them up on the pedestal and you
know, it can sometimes be a little

418
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:26,032
unfortunate that they would do something
like that but you know, I understand and

419
00:43:26,057 --> 00:43:33,041
because there's such an emphasis that's
been put on for so long about who's coming

420
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:38,067
out where just you know, how, also like
what he said earlier in the article you

421
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:42,068
know when he, when somebody said they were
from Harvard it was like everybody in the

422
00:43:42,068 --> 00:43:45,087
room got quiet you know and they were
like, oh, this guy is from Harvard. Just

423
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:51,005
like I understand that's what he's, that's
what he was explaining. And it kind of

424
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:58,053
seems to me like, I'm not sure if I got
the right, what you were saying was that

425
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:04,002
some, some of this, well, did really well
in the lower tier school like the they

426
00:44:04,002 --> 00:44:08,073
thought the, the state school, that they
only did as good as the people who are

427
00:44:08,073 --> 00:44:13,006
like average students in the Ivy League
School. >> No, no, no, no. It was exactly

428
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:17,006
the opposite of that. He is basically
saying that if you took the same person

429
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:23,002
who is admitted to both, then it's really
ultimately the individual who mattered

430
00:44:23,002 --> 00:44:26,025
more than. >> Okay. >> The social, the
social context. >> Okay, so, yes. I, I

431
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:30,035
just, I understood that he was talking
about that, that having, you know, having

432
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:35,013
pen on your resume, that's basically, you
know, the whole, the, the general thing

433
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:39,017
basically. Your dream is what you're
looking at. You know, when you're coming

434
00:44:39,017 --> 00:44:42,067
out of that school, you're grand and
people look at that and they think that

435
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:46,088
when you're coming out of Penn or Harvard,
you're like a Mercedes. >> Right. But his.

436
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:51,028
>> When you're coming out of Penn State.
>> But his point though is, and it's

437
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:55,047
important to clarify this and make sure
that we get on the same page on this point

438
00:44:55,047 --> 00:45:01,064
is that his point is that when you look at
the statistical data , for large numbers

439
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:08,010
of people then, those anecdotal stories
actually don't have as much explanatory

440
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:14,088
value as the analysis that he did would
have. Dickson, what do you think about

441
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:20,083
this? >> So, when I was reading over i t,
I was interested to see that he says that

442
00:45:21,004 --> 00:45:24,096
person who is accepted to Penn and the
person whose accepted to Penn State would

443
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:29,062
do the same thing but then I was
wondering, so admissions factors don't

444
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:34,086
always account for everything that person
is capable of. So, I think it might have

445
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:41,055
just outside of the scope for its project.
But I think that I would have been

446
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:47,021
interested at project have continued and
then look at. So what are the things that

447
00:45:47,021 --> 00:45:52,093
the, students for and how those affect
people in the upper strata that normally

448
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:58,087
wouldn't be affected by the treatment that
Princeton gives than, like the, really

449
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:04,025
lower, lower strata that I was talking
about earlier. >> I think that's very

450
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:10,028
interesting. So, basically, I hope that we
can use Alan Krueger's study as a way of

451
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:15,072
getting of thinking more about the
questions that I raised at the end of the

452
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:20,096
first lecture of how it is that the
individual makes a difference? And the

453
00:46:20,096 --> 00:46:26,047
extent to which we are truly trapped by
certain social circumstances. Sometimes,

454
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:33,009
we imagine that the social circumstances
that are surrounding us, are trapping us

455
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:39,092
in ways that they actually are not and it
takes constant sociological investigation

456
00:46:39,092 --> 00:46:47,056
to know the difference between a real trap
and an illusion of one. So, I want to end

457
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:54,061
today's discussion by just saying a little
bit about where we're going next. I want

458
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:59,003
to say, first of all, that this was an
experiment today. I, I know that the

459
00:46:59,003 --> 00:47:03,046
discussion was by no means perfect
although it was as good as I could have

460
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:09,041
ever hoped from a group of students around
the world and I thought that your comments

461
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:14,097
on the, in the seminar today were really
great and interesting and a wonderful

462
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:20,009
beginning. But technically it could be
improved and we will certainly work on

463
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:24,064
that in the weeks to come. I really
appreciate the patience of everybody whose

464
00:47:24,064 --> 00:47:29,040
watching as well as your interest and I
appreciate your support and your

465
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,014
understanding that we are part now of a
really big experiment. We're trying to do

466
00:47:34,014 --> 00:47:38,097
something new and I suspect that we're
going t o learn a lot along the way. When

467
00:47:38,097 --> 00:47:43,096
we meet the next time in the online forum,
we're going to include some new people

468
00:47:43,096 --> 00:47:47,072
that were not here today. We'll also have
some familiar faces. We'll try to

469
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:52,061
substitute some new people in to keep the
conversation representing different parts

470
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:57,075
of the world. And, we will try to do some
things to improve it each time until we

471
00:47:57,075 --> 00:48:01,055
really get to a point where it is
something that is working really well and

472
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:05,058
we are really happy with it. But I must
say that for the first time today, for the

473
00:48:05,058 --> 00:48:10,043
first effort, I'm really pleased with
this. I also, I wanted to say that I was

474
00:48:10,043 --> 00:48:16,004
really excited to see the large number of
study groups that had formed from around

475
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:22,036
the world and I wanted to also give a
special welcome to the people that are

476
00:48:22,036 --> 00:48:28,047
clearly participating in the, in the class
from Iran and from Afghanistan. Two

477
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:35,008
countries which do not have the greatest
relationship officially with the United

478
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:42,067
States today but that is certainly not due
to any ill feeling on the part of

479
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:49,008
Americans and we certainly all believe
that these kinds of contact are the ones

480
00:48:49,008 --> 00:48:54,016
that we should be having and I hope that
in our future online seminars that we can

481
00:48:54,016 --> 00:49:00,002
have representatives from Iran and from
Afghanistan with us as well. So, I 'm

482
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:05,057
going to say goodbye to you all now. So,
thank all of you online for participating

483
00:49:05,057 --> 00:49:11,002
in this wonderful experiment and I look
forward to seeing you this Monday with the

484
00:49:11,002 --> 00:49:16,071
second lecture in the discussion boards
which I will be monitoring very careful

485
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:26,007
and of course, in our second online
seminar next Wednesday.
