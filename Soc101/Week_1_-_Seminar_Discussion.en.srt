00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,443
Greetings everyone and welcome to the first session, our first live session of Introduction to Sociology.

2
00:00:07,443 --> 00:00:14,269
The last few days have been simply extraordinary in terms of the response and the discussion 

3
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:17,927
on the course website which I’ve been following.

4
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:22,547
Although I have not been able to respond to each and everyone of your postings, 

5
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:27,641
I want you to know that I’ve been looking carefully at the many things that you have written 

6
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:33,333
and I am so impressed with the level and quality of the discussion and the ways 

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:39,542
in which you are all helping one another along to develop a better understanding of the material.

8
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:46,485
This is peer learning at its best and this a very impressive group of students from all over the world.

9
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:52,244
I want to begin today by thanking my own administration.

10
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:57,120
The President and the provost, and the Dean of the faculty and the Dean of the college, 

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
and the Associate Dean, and the people at the McGraw Teaching Center, 

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:09,521
and the people working here in the broadcast center at Princeton University for making all of this possible.

13
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:16,680
It’s this university’s commitment to bringing courses like this to a wider public 

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,533
and being inclusive that has made this possible and their decision to devote the resources to this kind 

15
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:31,912
of enterprise makes me feel wonderful as a member of the Princeton faculty and I know that my colleagues 

16
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:39,705
on the Princeton faculty feel as though very similarly to me that this is a very special moment 

17
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:47,095
in the history of higher education that we are a part of, that we have the privilege of being a part of.

18
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:49,279
And, I want to say also that, you know, 

19
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:54,985
this is really part of a pretty long standing tradition here at Princeton:

20
00:01:54,985 --> 00:02:00,370
In our university we have a very generous financial aid package to students 

21
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,003
who come here from a very wide variety of backgrounds.

22
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:11,383
And one of the things that I think didn’t come across in the article by Malcolm Gladwell is the extent 

23
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:17,194
to which that is significant in the ongoing life of Princeton.

24
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:26,218
We have certainly the best financial aid package in the world and it is something that we are very proud of.

25
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:30,406
Probably 60 percent of our students are on financial aid.

26
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:34,543
Our students are not required to take out loans to come here.

27
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:41,005
The financial aid is available to students not only from the United States but from all over the world,

28
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:47,324
and it extends from $5,000 to $50,000 depending on the needs of an individual family 

29
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:53,232
in a given year and I have received questions over e-mail for students around the world asking whether 

30
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:58,513
or not it’s possible for people from outside the United States to apply for financially aid.

31
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,978
And the answer is yes, there are no limitations on 

32
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:08,173
that and financial need is not taking into consideration when admissions decisions are made.

33
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:11,500
Over ten percent of our student body comes from outside the United States 

34
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,642
and many of those students are on financial aid.

35
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:25,815
I want to talk today about the Malcolm Gladwell article but first I want to begin by discussing in some detail

36
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:32,255
the article that we read by C. Wright Mills which was written of course in 1959.

37
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:36,495
And I want to begin by welcoming the students from around the world 

38
00:03:36,495 --> 00:03:39,609
who are part of our seminar for today.

39
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:45,451
I should say at the outset that we invited a couple of more people to join us today and for technical reasons, 

40
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:49,600
some of them are not up on the screen — they might pop up during the course of our conversation.

41
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,040
But for the time being, we are going to speak with the people that are there.

42
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,862
I’d like them to introduce themselves to us beginning with the person on the far left, Dipendra.

43
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:03,281
And then let’s go to each person and I’d like the each of you 

44
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:08,505
to say something about what you thought was most interesting, something brief 

45
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:13,768
about what you thought was most interesting about Mills’s essay, The Promise.

46
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:14,808
Dipendra.

47
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:17,248
>> Hi, this is Di, Nepal.

48
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:26,131
And if you are wondering where Nepal is, we are in India [inaudible]. We’re a very small country, country.

49
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:35,065
I come from [inaudible]. My bachelors in rural development and I have a major in sociology as well.

50
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:41,351
Particular interested in, in this, today’s lecture by C. Wright Mills.

51
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:48,652
I’ve been very much fascinated for those examples of study relating to the institution 

52
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:56,641
of the society, specifically at his out during the lecture regarding divorce and marriage.

53
00:04:56,641 --> 00:05:00,056
That was one thing very much interesting to me.

54
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:04,928
Another thing we tried, at the last time, the text which is 

55
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:12,383
that if you want to develop your socialism then you should plays very mean.

56
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:16,606
So, that, about the thing that have been striking… 

57
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:17,906
>> Okay.

58
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:22,894
Dipendra unfortunately the connection to you was not great 

59
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:29,206
but I will summarize though that you thought that one of the most interesting things has 

60
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:35,324
to do with the connection of the sociological imagination to marriage and divorce.

61
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:42,052
And, we will look forward to hearing more from you later, hopefully with a better connection.

62
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:42,284
Doug?

63
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:43,444
>> Yeah, hi.

64
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,468
I’m Doug, I’m from Philadelphia.

65
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,332
I, I don’t know.

66
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:52,898
The Promise, I believe is the name of the paper.

67
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:56,400
I… My impression, it was really hard to understand — you know, 

68
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,846
trying to put myself back in 1959 and trying to understand where it was coming from.

69
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:08,933
It seemed almost like you’re just trying to focus on the psychology, I guess, of being trapped.

70
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:15,036
But I also want, I, I did understand the basic thing of where I was going with it.

71
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:19,071
>> Doug, could you tell us a little bit about yourself in Philadelphia.

72
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:21,839
>> Yeah, I’m a firefighter in Philadelphia.

73
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,633
34 years old which I think makes me the oldest member of the panel.

74
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:32,122
I you know, I took a little bit of college.

75
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:35,913
After high school I was in the Navy most of the time.

76
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:38,287
And now I’m trying to get back in college.

77
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:38,565
>>.

78
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,566
And are you, are you talking to us from the firehouse right now?

79
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:42,307
>> No.

80
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:44,036
No, I can’t.

81
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:44,283
>> [laugh] 

82
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,012
>> I can’t do that.

83
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:46,753
[laugh] .

84
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:47,000
>> [laugh] 

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,784
>> Everything that I say is — what — my opinion; it has nothing to do with the Fire Department.

86
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:54,060
But no, I’m at my house and yeah, I’m excited to [be] here.

87
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,840
>> Okay.

88
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,257
Thank you, Doug.

89
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:58,757
>> My name is Estela Diaz.

90
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:04,220
I’m a Princeton University student majoring in Sociology.

91
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:12,397
I’m originally from Los Angeles, California and currently living in Spanish Harlem in New York City.

92
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:19,330
One of the things I thought was most interesting is considering the sociological imagination 

93
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:27,609
in context of the United States 2012 political campaign and the presidential election.

94
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:32,172
I’m just kind of considering how issues are framed —

95
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:41,772
Whether they are framed as personal issues or public issues, specially the economic downturn.

96
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:43,560
>> Fascinating.

97
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,375
Is it Nana who’s next?

98
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,175
>> I’m Nana.

99
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,275
I’m from Georgia.

100
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:53,175
It’s Caucasus not Georgia in USA.

101
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:54,091
>> [laugh].

102
00:07:54,091 --> 00:08:03,990
>> I am working as a representative of Israeli delegation here in Georgia and Ukraine and in Belarus.

103
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,710
Also I have a travel company with my friend.

104
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:17,228
We’re dealing with the incoming tourists and for me the most I pay attention 

105
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:22,653
on the sociological imagination in the chapter one,:

106
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:29,116
it was quite interesting for me how people can imagine the scenes 

107
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:37,834
in the world, and also marriage and divorce, because in Georgia it’s quite complicated.

108
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,228
>> Thank you, Nana.

109
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,622
And then finally.

110
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:48,179
>> Hello, my name is [inaudible] University School of [inaudible] 

111
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:54,043
and National Relations which is the case in Southwestern Russia.

112
00:08:54,043 --> 00:09:00,904
I found this article very interesting because it’s effect 

113
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:12,697
that’s a lot just a moment in terms of historical change and even the so we have to, 

114
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:18,787
to think more, to think wider in this case.

115
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:20,983
>> That’s very interesting.

116
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:25,537
Okay, well, these are some very interesting ways of beginning our thinking 

117
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:30,783
about what Mills was trying to say and what I’d like to do now with you guys is 

118
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:35,821
to try to go through the essay in a little bit of detail from Kathmandu, 

119
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:40,964
to Siberia, to Georgia, to Spanish Harlem, to Philadelphia 

120
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:46,606
and talk about the meaning of some of these lines and how we should interpret them.

121
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:51,411
I want to begin with the first paragraph, the second line where Mills says, 

122
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:54,949
“they sensed that within their everyday world, 

123
00:09:54,949 --> 00:10:02,184
they cannot overcome their troubles and this feel, and this feeling they are quite often correct.”

124
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,884
One question that I want to ask you is this, is, 

125
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:11,069
is there some sense in which that line and the essay as a whole gives the impression, 

126
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,229
gives an impression to people 

127
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:22,690
that if only they can develop a sociological imagination, that they can overcome their troubles.

128
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,095
And is that really realistic?

129
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:34,023
What are some of the dilemmas involved in thinking about this in such a way?

130
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:34,710
>> Yeah.

131
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,374
I believe that was something that had,

132
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:42,529
something to do a little bit more of this psychology of it, you know, 

133
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,001
somebody that’s kinda trapped in their own

134
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:50,793
sometimes made-up shell. It’s because they feel — I mean it’s almost like looking at this minute, you know, 

135
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:53,553
I was never able… I wasn’t much of a person 

136
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:59,692
that was very smart coming out of high school, I guess, so I didn’t take the college route.

137
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:05,933
And as I got older, I wanted to go to college but now this is forwarding opportunity.

138
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:09,303
I feel like I’m widening now a little bit like from personal experience .

139
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:12,495
So that’s kinda like the way I look at it — like

140
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:18,356
instead of me sentencing that within my own shell, now I feel like I’m just through this course.

141
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,698
I’m feeling like I’m kind of getting over it.

142
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:22,104
>>.

143
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:26,773
And, and is there a sense though — I’m curious to know in which, 

144
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:31,699
does having a sociological imagination give us any legitimate reason to believe 

145
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:36,865
that we are in a better position to overcome our personal troubles?

146
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:45,927
Or is that an unrealistic kind of thing to begin the essay with?

147
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:54,394
>> I didn’t personally interpret it as such. Instead I interpreted this repeated notion 

148
00:11:54,394 --> 00:12:00,272
of not being able to overcome one’s personal troubles —

149
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:08,785
I interpreted that as Mills arguing for a larger perspective, not necessarily saying 

150
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:15,309
that having a sociological imagination will allow you to overcome troubles 

151
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:23,437
but instead emphasizing that our troubles are not strictly derived from the individual.

152
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:32,593
So Mills is arguing that having that sociological imagination will give you a different perspective on your troubles 

153
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:36,721
but it will not necessarily solve your troubles.

154
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,785
>> Very interesting.

155
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:42,736
Would anyone else like to comment on this?

156
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:51,502
>> I think almost the same because I, I think it’s not depend to overcome troubles.

157
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:57,695
It’s, it’s not coming from the sociological imagination, 

158
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:06,406
you can you can solve your troubles and solve your problems without knowing it but it helps you quite a lot.

159
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:06,924
>>.

160
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:10,112
And, but are you sure about that, Nana?

161
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:17,024
Are you really sure that having the sociological imagination would help you in solving the personal troubles?

162
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:17,780
>> No.

163
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,062
Like in Georgia [inaudible].

164
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:21,398
>> Oh, really?

165
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:24,404
Could you say more about that?

166
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:31,305
>> Like say in Georgia if, if you’re… like for people 

167
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:40,601
who are coming from abroad, it’s, it’s not easy to find some jobs.

168
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:44,201
If you are not an investor it’s not easy to find it.

169
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:50,793
If you know the sociological imagination like to help the, the, 

170
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:56,918
help people, how people think about it, you will not come in Georgia and start your work here.

171
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:59,612
You will go to another country to find some job.

172
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:01,861
Let’s say, let’s say this example.

173
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:06,311
>> So, in other words, having the socio… that’s a really good answer.

174
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:12,721
Having the sociological imagination is going to perhaps one way of having a sociological imagination 

175
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:17,759
is to know our probabilities, and understanding the probabilities means 

176
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,378
that we can access our chances and decide what we should try and what we shouldn’t try, right?

177
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,075
>> Yeah.

178
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,105
>> Okay.

179
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,783
But let me ask you a question Estela.

180
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,064
You’re a Princeton student, okay?

181
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:31,059
>> If you knew…

182
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:31,855
>> Mm-hm.

183
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:39,197
>> …the probabilities when you applied to Princeton of being accepted, would you have ever tried?

184
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:47,744
>> I mean, I think I kind of did know the probabilities with less than ten percent acceptance rate.

185
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:54,023
And over, I think it’s, it was about 30,000 people who applied, 

186
00:14:54,023 --> 00:15:04,457
higher, with only, with less than 2,000 of us being accepted, the probability was extremely low.

187
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:12,489
But you have to, in, in case, in the case of applying to Princeton University, 

188
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:18,987
I think there was something worth a lot more than, I think it was worth taking my chances.

189
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:19,004
>>.

190
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:24,422
But the thing is just: did having a sociological imagination and knowing the odds, 

191
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:27,992
did that increases the chance of you applying? Or don’t you think 

192
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:33,829
that there are some people who are having that knowledge might have said, “It’s not worth it to try at all”?

193
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:38,482
I mean, if somebody to finds out that the chances of doing, 

194
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:44,169
of succeeding in any field are small, does that knowledge necessarily help them in the end?

195
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:48,446
We assume, we’re assuming that it’s empowering to have 

196
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:52,499
that knowledge, but I wonder if it could also be disempowering.

197
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,126
>> I think it could…

198
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:55,851
>> Go ahead.

199
00:15:55,851 --> 00:16:04,807
>> it could certainly be discouraging, specially if you consider Mills’ article in general, 

200
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:13,337
he’s kind of taking away from the notion of individual agency and individual power.

201
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:20,226
So when you take that away, it does and can seem very discouraging.

202
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:23,466
>> Doug, what do you think about this?

203
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:30,075
>> Well, basically I think that Estela hit the nail right on the head.

204
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:34,677
That — you know — that sense of, you know, when like things are hopeless, 

205
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:38,063
people are going to say, “Why am I going to put the effort in?”

206
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:43,535
But, if you realize, like Estela did, that you know, that doesn’t just define 

207
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:47,275
who you are that, that you know, that 10%, if you’re going to part of

208
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:51,052
that 10%, you’re part of that ten percent like what are you going to do about it?

209
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,883
It is what it is, and that really, I think that could really be freeing for somebody 

210
00:16:55,883 --> 00:17:00,088
because that’s not going to really upset them if they turn around and get rejected.

211
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:04,066
They’ll say, okay, whatever, you know, although I was ready for that.

212
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,645
It’s kinda like a you know, expect the, 

213
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:12,003
expect the worst or “hope for the best and expect the worst” kind of thing, I guess.

214
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:14,271
And I don’t know if I am missing that point.

215
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:18,207
>> Let’s move on to the next part of the paper.

216
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:24,101
At the very beginning of the second paragraph, Mills says, “Underlying the sense 

217
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:30,834
of being trapped are seemingly impersonal changes the very structure of continent wide societies.”

218
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:35,061
There were some discussion on the discussion boards 

219
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:41,117
over the last few days about what Mills meant by impersonal changes.

220
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:46,269
And I thought that you guys did a very good job of clarifying the issue for those 

221
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:49,055
who were confused, but what does this mean to you?

222
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,323
What are some of the kinds of impersonal changes 

223
00:17:52,323 --> 00:18:00,415
that affect you in the society in which you live as a way of conceiving of what Mills is talking about?

224
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:02,382
Dipendra, could you start?

225
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:06,893
>> In, in, I was very much interested 

226
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:12,358
in the previous paragraph so I was about to speak but I lost my connection.

227
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:18,223
So, maybe I would rather go back to that paragraph and I’ll resume to this paragraph at the end.

228
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,012
>> Sure, why don’t you do that.

229
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:21,308
>> So, in the previous thing.

230
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,604
>> Go ahead, please do.

231
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:27,774
>> So, I have a different I have a, I have a different perspective on 

232
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:36,440
that it does say, it is said that within the everyday works they cannot overcome the troubles.

233
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,705
I want to keep myself in this example.

234
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:42,378
I have my parents divorced.

235
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:49,162
So in this actually when my parents, then was suddenly, the problem that I’m facing in the world.

236
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:55,939
So, I, believe is facing this kind of problem and I was so I have a small sister 

237
00:18:55,939 --> 00:19:01,663
and I have my mom crying in front of me every day and my dad, dad was with another woman.

238
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:05,914
So, how I felt, it was like I felt that this was only me.

239
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:09,036
This is only, I’m the guy problem.

240
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:14,844
But sociological imagination, I think that in a broader perspective, 

241
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:25,251
when I look at my society then I see a lot of people who get who get divorced so then, then I do is, 

242
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:33,266
I simply hiding myself and say that, okay boy, this is, this is not only the way you move ahead.

243
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:39,014
It’s not, spend your whole life regretting because your dad married to another woman or something.

244
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:46,558
So, when I look at only… when I think that is my problem only and I feel I’m trapped in that problem.

245
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:53,449
But when I come out of my family, when I come out, when I look at my society then I feel a lot, 

246
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:59,461
this is the broader perspective that I should look into and that, that is, that really motivated me.

247
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:04,782
>> Well, I think that, that is a really wonderful statement because what you’re saying 

248
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:11,540
is that you feel as though the understanding that your experience was not a personal problem 

249
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,722
but was part of a larger trend and a larger public issue inspired you to feel empowered.

250
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:22,768
And that you decided that you are going to rise above your social circumstances with 

251
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:26,718
that knowledge knowing that was not your fault or knowing 

252
00:20:26,718 --> 00:20:32,675
that this was not the fault of your family — and I actually, I think 

253
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:38,165
that’s a really excellent response to my concern and it’s, it’s really a nice response 

254
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:42,454
because I think that in the case of divorce, it’s true that many children feel 

255
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:46,776
as though they are themselves the cause of their parents divorce so they feel 

256
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:50,216
as though they are responsible for it and certainly it’s true 

257
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:56,093
that their family members blame themselves, and I think it is the case that if you know 

258
00:20:56,093 --> 00:21:02,051
that you’re part of something larger and wider, perhaps that is actually empowering

259
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:06,019
to be able to get beyond it and move beyond it.

260
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:13,461
And yet I must tell you that I feel still nevertheless a certain concern over these lines 

261
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:21,494
and what they imply in the essay because for many people, you know, their lives are just really hard.

262
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:28,200
And, it is going to be hard for them whether they know that they’re part of a larger social trend or not.

263
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,501
And the ability to rise beyond their social circumstances, 

264
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:41,157
I worry takes a lot more obviously than any kind of knowledge or understanding of this kind 

265
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:52,258
but perhaps that’s just obvious and not worth being overly concerned with.

266
00:21:52,258 --> 00:22:00,033
By the way, in our Princeton Seminars, there are moments, as Estela will tell you, of complete silence.

267
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:04,458
And I encourage those moments in my seminar. I believe in silence.

268
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,801
I think it’s great for people to be able to sit and think for a second.

269
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:13,516
Sometimes we’ll have silence for 30 seconds in the room before somebody talks.

270
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:20,088
We shouldn’t always feel pressured to fill in every gap at every moment, and no more so just 

271
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:24,319
because we happen to be on the Internet for 30,000 other students right now.

272
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:30,043
Does anybody else have anything they wanted to add to that before we move on there, then?

273
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:30,758
>> Yes.

274
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:32,864
May I add something?

275
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:34,970
It will be kind of question.

276
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:41,404
When, when you are talking in your lecture about sociological imagination, 

277
00:22:41,404 --> 00:22:48,500
we find that mortgage and divorce, situations and issues. I remember the words 

278
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:56,223
of Soviets secrets General Joseph Stalin ’cause he once said to Averill Harriman he said, 

279
00:22:56,223 --> 00:23:01,853
“The death if one man is a tragedy, the death of million is statistic.”

280
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:08,600
I’d like to know that I am not a fan of Joseph Stalin, and my opinion [is that] he was a dictator.

281
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,342
That was just the first thing that came to my mind,

282
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:17,472
whether there is an argument, whether he said it or not.

283
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:24,421
So I wanted to ask a bit political question.

284
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:32,085
He said that in terms of historical change has also Mills noted,

285
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:41,457
our lives are only a moment so today anything around us could be revealed 

286
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:48,335
as statistic — even our lives can be a statistic within this scope 

287
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:56,174
of the population size, and then the scope of many other issues.

288
00:23:56,174 --> 00:24:00,172
So our president tells about wages.

289
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:06,199
When he tells about wages, he cites average wages data.

290
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:13,207
Why doesn’t he cite the lowest [inaudible], for example Tatiana 

291
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:23,716
who is which a school teacher in Siberia in who has four children and tries to survive with four kids.

292
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:26,201
How do you think, professor?

293
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:31,781
Can the government treat its people just as a statistic?

294
00:24:31,781 --> 00:24:37,854
And where is the border of statistic and the real life?

295
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:43,063
>> Well, I think that it’s very tempting to use a single statistic, 

296
00:24:43,063 --> 00:24:47,064
and of course what a sociological imagination is going 

297
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:52,975
to do, is going to try to encourage people to look at the variation,

298
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:57,711
and to try to explain the variation in a society.

299
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:04,404
And, I think that there’s always a tendency to try to put the focus in one place or the other 

300
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:09,409
but your job is as a sociologist is to move toward and understanding and grasping of 

301
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,859
that variation in which you just did in your wonderful comment and 

302
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:23,053
that’s a great quote which I’m sure that I’ll be using in the future when I give this lecture again.

303
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:27,302
I want to ask you guys to take a peek though at the notion of 

304
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:34,427
that first line in the essay, and I want to get back to this issue of impersonal changes.

305
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:40,532
Could you guys try to think about what that means, and try to help the students 

306
00:25:40,532 --> 00:25:46,736
who were concerned about that all on the website to reflect on that a little bit more?

307
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:51,879
What are some of the impersonal changes in your society?

308
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:56,026
Nana has gone off, why do we go to Doug?

309
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:59,492
>> When I look at these line as far as impersonal changes, 

310
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:02,431
I felt like that was something that, you know, in an ,

311
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:07,691
in an, in a time, I mean, it was brought up before about what’s going on with the housing crisis, 

312
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,060
with the job crisis and everything else.

313
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,810
And at the time when jobs are, you know, so few and far between, somebody 

314
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:20,020
can very easily think of themselves whether there’s something wrong with me that’s why I’m not working.

315
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,024
Then, if they look at the, you know, the way that everything is in the society, 

316
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,932
it’s not a, it’s not a personal change 

317
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:29,892
that you need to make, it’s the way that the society is that, you know, that the, 

318
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:34,981
the structure and as it go, the very structure of the kind of wide society 

319
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:39,114
that if there’s, there’s change made to the system,

320
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:43,377
not something that has to do with this one person — like I feel like 

321
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:46,069
that line is trying to give somebody a little bit of hope you know, 

322
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:49,099
like look it’s not you, you have the ability, you just need to understand 

323
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:52,125
that there’s a problem out there right now, I think we’re just going 

324
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:57,050
to need to try a little bit harder and don’t let yourself down and don’t feel like you’re trapped.

325
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,600
>> Okay.

326
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,530
Estela?

327
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,250
>> No, I think he saw that very well.

328
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,420
I’m trying to think.

329
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:16,366
I’m looking at what he says the structure of continent wide societies and just contextualizing this 

330
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:24,411
in nineteen…, I mean, if we consider the effect of the Internet now in our very discussion here today, 

331
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:31,233
where we were discussing this with people on various continents, various countries.

332
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:41,924
So looking at impersonal changes, that’s something far beyond our what he says as personal troubles,…

333
00:27:41,924 --> 00:27:42,782
>> Yeah.

334
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:46,215
I think that one of the things that, 

335
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:51,205
that concerns me about this point as well is that, you know, 

336
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:58,194
the emphasis on, obviously, the impersonal changes and that as if they are always trapping us.

337
00:27:58,194 --> 00:28:03,826
And I think that we have to have more a nuanced view of it — at least I would propose 

338
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:08,684
that — and the, you know, the impersonal change of today,

339
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:15,707
of the Internet obviously is also leading to possibilities like the one that we have before us right now.

340
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:18,554
And, I think that our job as sociologists 

341
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:23,340
is to look at the ways in which impersonal changes not only trap us, 

342
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,240
but also liberate us and potentially make us more free.

343
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,817
And I wonder whether or not anybody could present an example other than the Internet 

344
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:37,306
of any kind of impersonal change in their own society.

345
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:42,958
Or perhaps the internet is the best one for your society right now that you’d like to refer to,

346
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:57,306
but in which the actual impersonal change has been liberating rather than simply constraining.

347
00:28:57,306 --> 00:29:05,043
Remember silence is fine.

348
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:14,295
Silence is good in the seminar.

349
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:20,463
Everyone can think.

350
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:29,432
>> I think that was a good example, try to recover other issues.

351
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:30,877
>> Okay.

352
00:29:30,877 --> 00:29:35,037
Well maybe we can ask our online viewers,

353
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:42,840
the other members of the class, to think about that issue a little bit as we move forward in the class.

354
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,936
I want to move on now to a discussion of the New Yorker article 

355
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:55,600
that was written by the great writer, the great non-fiction writer, Malcolm Gladwell.

356
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,515
And I saw some questions on the discussion boards 

357
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:05,545
about why I would have assigned this article for the first class.

358
00:30:05,545 --> 00:30:10,761
And in fact, the article was assigned for exactly the reason 

359
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:15,155
that many of you proposed in your answers to the person who asked 

360
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:20,737
that question: because I believe it exemplifies the sociological imagination.

361
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,657
Can you guys hear me right now?

362
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:22,897
Yes?

363
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:24,577
Okay, good.

364
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:30,724
So, let’s begin now by talking a little bit about Gladwell’s article.

365
00:30:30,724 --> 00:30:37,878
Gladwell being a Canadian who came to the United States and was kind of intrigued by the culture 

366
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:43,826
of New York City in which he found that there were many people who are obsessed with Harvard 

367
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:51,786
in particular, and who seemed to think that if they had gone there that there was nothing 

368
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:56,913
of greater importance that could have happened to them in their lives.

369
00:30:56,913 --> 00:31:00,070
And he wrote this essay based on the, as we know, 

370
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:06,502
based on the research of sociologist Jerome Karabel largely, about 

371
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:12,602
the nature of admissions at Harvard, 

372
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:19,332
Princeton and Yale, and the way in which it moved in the direction that it is in today.

373
00:31:19,332 --> 00:31:26,102
And, one of the things that I found very interesting about the responses on the Internet to this was 

374
00:31:26,102 --> 00:31:28,751
that, there were many people 

375
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:34,967
who saw the decision of the Ivy League Schools to look at the whole person 

376
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:39,536
rather than a single dimension as meaning, as implying that, 

377
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:44,816
that was somehow a false promise, or that people 

378
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:50,063
have been excluded that people, that they themselves were being promised something 

379
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:55,423
that wasn’t really fair or obtainable when they were given

380
00:31:55,423 --> 00:32:01,360
the hope that they one day could achieve or go to an Ivy League School.

381
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,219
And I’m just curious about that response because my own feeling about it in looking at the way 

382
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:12,090
that the system of college admissions emerged is that, while I think it’s good 

383
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:18,361
that the largest group of students in the university has gotten there because of their academic achievement,

384
00:32:18,361 --> 00:32:23,420
I think that it is also true that there are so many other qualities in life 

385
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,201
that make for a deserving and an interesting human being.

386
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:31,699
And, would we really want a college to only include the people 

387
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:37,134
who have the highest scores rather than a system like the one 

388
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:43,038
that has been designed which actually looks at a much wider variety of personal characteristics?

389
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,901
And I’m just curious about what your response was to some 

390
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:53,652
of those comments and how you would design a system like this if it was to you.

391
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:55,467
Dipendra.

392
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:59,322
>> Actually when I was going through this lecture, 

393
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:03,070
what I’ve heard was the education system the admission system 

394
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,470
that was there and unfortunately, in Nepal, I’ve been practicing that now.

395
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,640
So, we have the, actually a brief background of 

396
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,484
the admission system that we have here and then I’ll get back to my point.

397
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:26,168
So, here at Nepal, what was there are typically two different kinds of colleges or universities.

398
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:32,940
The primary targets of all the university and all the college here in Nepal is you should get at least good marks —

399
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,900
at least, [inaudible] more than 60 percent or more than three GPA — 

400
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,421
so that you can get into good college or something like that.

401
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:47,616
And very few, very few colleges and universities — we count in hands or fingers — 

402
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:54,049
that they’ll look overall student or they look at overall characteristics of students.

403
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:59,142
So it would depend, but I would like to say seeing, to look at examples 

404
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:05,042
that I have seen here in Nepal, what I have come to conclude is typically, 

405
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:09,994
there are two different university here that I would like to mention in Nepal.

406
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:15,224
The Tribhuvan University which is government owned university and Kathmandu University 

407
00:34:15,224 --> 00:34:17,549
that is privately owned university.

408
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:20,166
So, why does Tribhuvan University does it?

409
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:24,655
They don’t have a proper definite system of taking in students.

410
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:28,737
So, every time they have it, they get admission in that college.

411
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:35,372
They have let’s say you have crossed 50 percent then you’ll get into that university — and where I am now.

412
00:34:35,372 --> 00:34:41,459
And before coming to this university, I actually dropped the Kathmandu University 

413
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:46,441
because private university and which required rigorous competition.

414
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:50,961
They had added a baseline for academics.

415
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:55,469
We need to get at least 60 percent in your high school, then 

416
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:59,584
you should be astounding in extra curricular activities, 

417
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:05,031
you should be astounding in sports, you should be social and so many characteristics.

418
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:08,732
And where the products that come out after, 

419
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:15,252
in the universities after four years, we can see a clear distinction here in Nepal:

420
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:18,144
Kathmandu University 

421
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,811
which has the system of looking student from all dimension, the students 

422
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:28,266
are… they are very practical, they know a lot of things, you know, 

423
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:34,390
they are outgoing; and while we look at the students of Tribhuvan University, 

424
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,770
what I see is students are very much confined to books — 

425
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,009
not even in textbooks, we have just papers here.

426
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:45,735
That means the questions that, the exams.

427
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:48,551
So there are some predicted questions and you go through 

428
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:53,365
that question and you will get questions out of that.

429
00:35:53,365 --> 00:36:01,322
It is sometimes… that’s really a very difficult task at Tribhuvan University.

430
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:09,884
So, what I feel is, for a college student to get admission, academics would be one of the primary criteria,

431
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:16,043
but we should have also look at students in overall — how good they meddle in society.

432
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:18,032
How a good in sports.

433
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:18,769
>> Thank you.

434
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:21,633
Thank you for that interesting comment, Dipendra.

435
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,941
Would anyone else like to comment on this?

436
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:25,489
>> Yes, may I comment.

437
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:26,005
>> Yes.

438
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:26,349
>>.

439
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:32,009
Because getting in is a very present problem for me and now I’m graduating 

440
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:39,113
in a few days and then I’ll be I have to find educate masters program.

441
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:46,485
And while I was reading, getting in article, I, I have a feeling you know, 

442
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:57,699
well, the situation that existed in the beginning of the twentieth Century in Harvard University and Yale etc.

443
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:02,170
With standardized this now exists in Russia, 

444
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:09,461
in the twenty-first Century, in the beginning of twenty-first Century.

445
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:18,787
So, I think it’s not a good way to admit students just on the basis of standardized tests.

446
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:27,332
Academic records is a very is, is an important problem 

447
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:41,171
but, but while admitting they should see they should see the person hopeless 

448
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:48,448
and hopeless and hope, he’s begral, he’s experienced.

449
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:53,966
What he can do maybe just melt on the, his studies.

450
00:37:53,966 --> 00:37:59,281
>> So, it’s interesting to hear your perspectives on this and it is true 

451
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:07,654
that outside the United States that the standards are usually much more narrow for admissions decisions.

452
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:12,510
And I think that, that is what accounted for some of the surprise 

453
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:18,584
that initially came on to the site about the way that it’s done here in the United States.

454
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:22,744
I want to, oh, I see we have another person that just joined us.

455
00:38:22,744 --> 00:38:25,756
Another Princeton student named Dickson Lee.

456
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:27,136
Hi, Dickson.

457
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:28,286
>> Hi, Mitch.

458
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:35,593
>> So, we’re talking right now about the Malcolm Gladwell essay and one of the interesting points 

459
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:39,120
that I want to sort of end by thinking about, 

460
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,613
is something that came up a lot on the discussion boards which was the study 

461
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,519
that was cited and this is for everybody, not just for Dickson.

462
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:55,812
The study that was cited by Gladwell, by my colleague Alan Krueger, who did a study of the people 

463
00:38:55,812 --> 00:39:01,623
who were let’s say, hypothetically, as it’s described in the article, 

464
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:09,779
accepted into a state university like Penn State, at a private university like the University of Pennsylvania.

465
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:14,890
And what was his point in making that comparison and what did he find.

466
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,962
Does anybody remember?

467
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:22,927
It certainly listed on a lot of response on the, the discussion board.

468
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:28,105
So they referred to it as comparing apples to apples.

469
00:39:28,105 --> 00:39:37,621
And what they discovered is that both, both the person who decides to go to more elite university, 

470
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:45,517
“elites.” and the person who decides to go to state school, both do well in the future.

471
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:53,689
With the finding of one exemption which is those from the lowest economic strata.

472
00:39:53,689 --> 00:40:01,009
Those from this strata were seen as benefiting from the elite’s education.

473
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:07,140
And it didn’t say, it didn’t explained this in anyway but that was the finding.

474
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,810
>> Can anybody explain, thank you Estela.

475
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,629
Can anybody explain to us what was the logic of the article.

476
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:18,720
He used the word selection and treatment and what was the exact way 

477
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:26,779
in which he went about doing study in which those words became so important.

478
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:28,963
What was he measuring?

479
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:30,874
What was he comparing?

480
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:36,544
Does anybody have any memory of that aspect of the article?

481
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:39,254
What was Krueger doing there?

482
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:46,166
In the traditional, it’s just to jog your memory, 

483
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:51,783
in the traditional measures of the impact of an Ivy League educati on, 

484
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:56,175
comparisons have been made between the salaries of people 

485
00:40:56,175 --> 00:41:01,270
who graduated from Ivy League Schools and the salaries of people 

486
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:08,339
who graduated from other schools and what Kruger said was, let’s change the comparison.

487
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,483
Instead of comparing it in that way, how did we do it?

488
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:19,368
He compared the people who were the same person.

489
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:25,675
He only took people who were graduated, who admitted both to private schools, 

490
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:32,048
to Ivy League Schools and to other schools and who chose for some reason, to go to the other school instead.

491
00:41:32,048 --> 00:41:35,728
And he compared those same people against the average people 

492
00:41:35,728 --> 00:41:38,693
who came out of Ivy League Schools and he found out 

493
00:41:38,693 --> 00:41:44,759
that those people actually did just as well as the people who went to Ivy League Schools.

494
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:49,026
And so his point was, that it was not necessarily the treatment 

495
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:53,904
of going to an Ivy League School that matter, in terms of the success 

496
00:41:53,904 --> 00:42:01,618
of people but it was instead the, the, the selection into the system from the very beginning 

497
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:05,933
of certain kinds of people that were destined to be successful.

498
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:10,650
And he basically, despite the fact that he’s a Princeton professor and have, 

499
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,930
has every reason to be biased in favor of the Ivy League, 

500
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,112
he concluded that the impact of the Ivy League is not nearly 

501
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:24,411
as great as it’s taken to be by the wider society and the wider world.

502
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:28,418
Now it seems to me that kind of analysis that Krueger did, 

503
00:42:28,418 --> 00:42:32,282
is in the best tradition of the sociological imagination.

504
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:37,797
And it seems to me that, that kind of information should be empowering to many people regardless 

505
00:42:37,797 --> 00:42:44,781
of whether or not they would even want to come to Princeton or some other Ivy League School.

506
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:50,725
Did you guys did that, did that information make a similar impression on you guys?

507
00:42:50,725 --> 00:42:54,631
What effect did it have on you to read that part of the article?

508
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:56,935
>> Yeah, it’s understood.

509
00:42:56,935 --> 00:43:00,631
Yeah, I understand what you’re saying.

510
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:07,938
The, the, the one, the one quote that he has here is having pen on your resume opens doors.

511
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:14,843
And I do notice that there is that sort of the meanest attitude when it comes to society in general.

512
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,903
People turn and mayb e look at certain people or certain kind of way 

513
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:20,317
and to put them up on the pedestal and you know, 

514
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:25,857
it can sometimes be a little unfortunate that they would do something like that but you know, I understand 

515
00:43:25,857 --> 00:43:31,446
and because there’s such an emphasis that’s been put on for so long 

516
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:36,803
about who’s coming out where just you know, how, also like what he said earlier 

517
00:43:36,803 --> 00:43:41,759
in the article you know when he, when somebody said they were from Harvard it was like everybody 

518
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:44,948
in the room got quiet you know and they were like, oh, this guy is from Harvard.

519
00:43:44,948 --> 00:43:49,970
Just like I understand that’s what he’s, that’s what he was explaining.

520
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:55,782
And it kind of seems to me like, I’m not sure if I got the right, 

521
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:59,949
what you were saying was that some, some of this, 

522
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:06,480
well, did really well in the lower tier school like the they thought the, the state school, that they only did 

523
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,776
as good as the people who are like average students in the Ivy League School.

524
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:12,207
>> No, no, no, no.

525
00:44:12,207 --> 00:44:14,383
It was exactly the opposite of that.

526
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:18,846
He is basically saying that if you took the same person who is admitted to both, 

527
00:44:18,846 --> 00:44:23,457
then it’s really ultimately the individual who mattered more than.

528
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:23,912
>> Okay.

529
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:24,913
>> The social, the social context.

530
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:25,732
>> Okay, so, yes.

531
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:29,699
I, I just, I understood that he was talking about that, that having, you know, 

532
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:36,057
having pen on your resume, that’s basically, you know, the whole, the, the general thing basically.

533
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:37,797
Your dream is what you’re looking at.

534
00:44:37,797 --> 00:44:41,045
You know, when you’re coming out of that school, you’re grand and people look at 

535
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:45,027
that and they think that when you’re coming out of Penn or Harvard, you’re like a Mercedes.

536
00:44:45,027 --> 00:44:45,471
>> Right.

537
00:44:45,471 --> 00:44:46,088
But his.

538
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:48,673
>> When you’re coming out of Penn State.

539
00:44:48,673 --> 00:44:49,143
>>.

540
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:53,108
But his point though is, and it’s important to clarify this and make sure 

541
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:56,091
that we get on the same page on this point is that his point 

542
00:44:56,091 --> 00:45:02,349
is that when you look at the statistical data , for large numbers of people then, 

543
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:11,898
those anecdotal stories actually don’t have as much explanatory value as the analysis that he did would have.

544
00:45:11,898 --> 00:45:14,318
Dickson, what do you think about this?

545
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:21,272
>> So, when I was reading over i t, I was interested to see that he says that person 

546
00:45:21,272 --> 00:45:25,276
who is accepted to Penn and the person whose accepted to Penn State would do the same thing 

547
00:45:25,276 --> 00:45:32,642
but then I was wondering, so admissions factors don’t always account for everything that person is capable of.

548
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:38,328
So, I think it might have just outside of the scope for its project.

549
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:45,339
But I think that I would have been interested at project have continued and then look at.

550
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:51,201
So what are the things that the, students for and how those affect people in the upper strata 

551
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:54,583
that normally wouldn’t be affected by the treatment 

552
00:45:54,583 --> 00:46:02,731
that Princeton gives than, like the, really lower, lower strata that I was talking about earlier.

553
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:05,147
>> I think that’s very interesting.

554
00:46:05,147 --> 00:46:09,074
So, basically, I hope that we can use Alan Krueger’s study 

555
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:13,868
as a way of getting of thinking more about the questions that I raised 

556
00:46:13,868 --> 00:46:19,272
at the end of the first lecture of how it is that the individual makes a difference?

557
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:24,936
And the extent to which we are truly trapped by certain social circumstances.

558
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:31,654
Sometimes, we imagine that the social circumstances that are surrounding us, 

559
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:39,092
are trapping us in ways that they actually are not and it takes constant sociological investigation 

560
00:46:39,092 --> 00:46:45,340
to know the difference between a real trap and an illusion of one.

561
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:53,496
So, I want to end today’s discussion by just saying a little bit about where we’re going next.

562
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:57,904
I want to say, first of all, that this was an experiment today.

563
00:46:57,904 --> 00:47:01,629
I, I know that the discussion was by no means perfect although it was 

564
00:47:01,629 --> 00:47:07,891
as good as I could have ever hoped from a group of students around the world and I thought 

565
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:15,327
that your comments on the, in the seminar today were really great and interesting and a wonderful beginning.

566
00:47:15,327 --> 00:47:21,305
But technically it could be improved and we will certainly work on that in the weeks to come.

567
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,560
I really appreciate the patience of everybody whose watching 

568
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,832
as well as your interest and I appreciate your support and your understanding 

569
00:47:29,832 --> 00:47:33,198
that we are part now of a really big experiment.

570
00:47:33,198 --> 00:47:37,924
We’re trying to do something new and I suspect that we’re going t o learn a lot along the way.

571
00:47:37,924 --> 00:47:40,883
When we meet the next time in the online forum, 

572
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:44,548
we’re going to include some new people that were not here today.

573
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:46,528
We’ll also have some familiar faces.

574
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:53,021
We’ll try to substitute some new people in to keep the conversation representing different parts of the world.

575
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:57,642
And, we will try to do some things to improve it each time until we really get 

576
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:02,617
to a point where it is something that is working really well and we are really happy with it.

577
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:07,634
But I must say that for the first time today, for the first effort, I’m really pleased with this.

578
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:14,187
I also, I wanted to say that I was really excited to see the large number of study groups 

579
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:21,275
that had formed from around the world and I wanted to also give a special welcome to the people 

580
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:27,796
that are clearly participating in the, in the class from Iran and from Afghanistan.

581
00:48:27,796 --> 00:48:33,483
Two countries which do not have the greatest relationship officially 

582
00:48:33,483 --> 00:48:40,822
with the United States today but that is certainly not due to any ill feeling 

583
00:48:40,822 --> 00:48:47,053
on the part of Americans and we certainly all believe that these kinds of 

584
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:52,208
contact are the ones that we should be having and I hope that in our future 

585
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:59,099
online seminars that we can have representatives from Iran and from Afghanistan with us as well.

586
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,246
So, I ’m going to say goodbye to you all now.

587
00:49:02,246 --> 00:49:07,379
So, thank all of you online for participating in this wonderful experiment 

588
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:12,057
and I look forward to seeing you this Monday with the second lecture 

589
00:49:12,057 --> 00:49:16,071
in the discussion boards which I will be monitoring very careful 

590
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:26,007
and of course, in our second online seminar next Wednesday.
