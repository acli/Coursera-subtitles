00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,044
Greetings everyone and welcome to the first session, our first live session of Introduction to Sociology.

2
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:14,026
The last few days have been simply extraordinary in terms of the response and the discussion

3
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:17,092
on the course website which I’ve been following.

4
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:22,054
Although I have not been able to respond to each and everyone of your postings,

5
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:27,064
I want you to know that I’ve been looking carefully at the many things that you have written

6
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:33,033
and I am so impressed with the level and quality of the discussion and the ways

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,098
in which you are all helping one another along to develop a better understanding of the material.

8
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:46,048
This is peer learning at its best and this a very impressive group of students from all over the world.

9
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:52,024
I want to begin today by thanking my own administration.

10
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:57,011
The President and the provost, and the Dean of the faculty and the Dean of the college,

11
00:00:57,011 --> 00:01:01,052
and the Associate Dean, and the people at the McGraw Teaching Center,

12
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:08,081
and the people working here in the broadcast center at Princeton University for making all of this possible.

13
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:16,068
It’s this university’s commitment to bringing courses like this to a wider public

14
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:21,020
and being inclusive that has made this possible

15
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,053
and their decision to devote the resources to this kind of enterprise

16
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:31,091
makes me feel wonderful as a member of the Princeton faculty and I know that my colleagues

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:39,070
on the Princeton faculty feel as though very similarly to me that this is a very special moment

18
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:46,069
in the history of higher education that we are a part of, that we have the privilege of being a part of.

19
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,027
And, I want to say also that, you know,

20
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:54,098
this is really part of a pretty long standing tradition here at Princeton:

21
00:01:54,098 --> 00:02:00,037
In our university we have a very generous financial aid package to students

22
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,000
who come here from a very wide variety of backgrounds.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,038
And one of the things that I think didn’t come across in the article by Malcolm Gladwell is the extent

24
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,019
to which that is significant in the ongoing life of Princeton.

25
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:26,021
We have certainly the best financial aid package in the world and it is something that we are very proud of.

26
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:30,040
Probably 60 percent of our students are on financial aid.

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,054
Our students are not required to take out loans to come here.

28
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:41,000
The financial aid is available to students not only from the United States but from all over the world,

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,032
and it extends from $5,000 to $50,000 depending on the needs of an individual family

30
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:53,023
in a given year and I have received questions over e-mail for students around the world asking whether

31
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:58,051
or not it’s possible for people from outside the United States to apply for financially aid.

32
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,097
And the answer is yes, there are no limitations on

33
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:08,017
that and financial need is not taking into consideration when admissions decisions are made.

34
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:11,050
Over ten percent of our student body comes from outside the United States

35
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,064
and many of those students are on financial aid.

36
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:25,081
I want to talk today about the Malcolm Gladwell article but first I want to begin by discussing in some detail

37
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:32,025
the article that we read by C. Wright Mills which was written of course in 1959.

38
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:36,049
And I want to begin by welcoming the students from around the world

39
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,060
who are part of our seminar for today.

40
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,045
I should say at the outset that we invited a couple of more people to join us today and for technical reasons,

41
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:49,059
some of them are not up on the screen — they might pop up during the course of our conversation.

42
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:54,003
But for the time being, we are going to speak with the people that are there.

43
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:59,086
I’d like them to introduce themselves to us beginning with the person on the far left, Dipendra.

44
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:03,028
And then let’s go to each person and I’d like the each of you

45
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:08,050
to say something about what you thought was most interesting, something brief

46
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,076
about what you thought was most interesting about Mills’s essay, The Promise.

47
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,080
Dipendra.

48
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,024
>> Hi, this is Di, Nepal.

49
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:26,013
And if you are wondering where Nepal is, we are in India [inaudible]. We’re a very small country, country.

50
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:35,006
I come from [inaudible]. My bachelors in rural development and I have a major in sociology as well.

51
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:41,035
Particular interested in, in this, today’s lecture by C. Wright Mills.

52
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:48,065
I’ve been very much fascinated for those examples of study relating to the institution

53
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:56,064
of the society, specifically at his out during the lecture regarding divorce and marriage.

54
00:04:56,064 --> 00:05:00,005
That was one thing very much interesting to me.

55
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:04,092
Another thing we tried, at the last time, the text which is

56
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:12,038
that if you want to develop your socialism then you should plays very mean.

57
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:16,060
So, that, about the thing that have been striking…

58
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,090
>> Okay.

59
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,089
Dipendra unfortunately the connection to you was not great

60
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:29,020
but I will summarize though that you thought that one of the most interesting things has

61
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:35,032
to do with the connection of the sociological imagination to marriage and divorce.

62
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:42,005
And, we will look forward to hearing more from you later, hopefully with a better connection.

63
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:42,028
Doug?

64
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:43,044
>> Yeah, hi.

65
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:46,046
I’m Doug, I’m from Philadelphia.

66
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,033
I, I don’t know.

67
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:52,089
The Promise, I believe is the name of the paper.

68
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:56,039
I… My impression, it was really hard to understand — you know,

69
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,084
trying to put myself back in 1959 and trying to understand where it was coming from.

70
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:08,093
It seemed almost like you’re just trying to focus on the psychology, I guess, of being trapped.

71
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:15,003
But I also want, I, I did understand the basic thing of where I was going with it.

72
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:19,007
>> Doug, could you tell us a little bit about yourself in Philadelphia.

73
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:21,083
>> Yeah, I’m a firefighter in Philadelphia.

74
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:27,063
34 years old which I think makes me the oldest member of the panel.

75
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:32,012
I you know, I took a little bit of college.

76
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:35,091
After high school I was in the Navy most of the time.

77
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:38,028
And now I’m trying to get back in college.

78
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:38,056
>>.

79
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:41,056
And are you, are you talking to us from the firehouse right now?

80
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:42,030
>> No.

81
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,003
No, I can’t.

82
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:44,028
>> [laugh]

83
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,001
>> I can’t do that.

84
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:46,075
[laugh] .

85
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:47,000
>> [laugh]

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,078
>> Everything that I say is — what — my opinion; it has nothing to do with the Fire Department.

87
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:54,006
But no, I’m at my house and yeah, I’m excited to [be] here.

88
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:54,083
>> Okay.

89
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,025
Thank you, Doug.

90
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:58,075
>> My name is Estela Diaz.

91
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:04,022
I’m a Princeton University student majoring in Sociology.

92
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:12,039
I’m originally from Los Angeles, California and currently living in Spanish Harlem in New York City.

93
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:19,032
One of the things I thought was most interesting is considering the sociological imagination

94
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:27,060
in context of the United States 2012 political campaign and the presidential election.

95
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,017
I’m just kind of considering how issues are framed —

96
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:41,077
Whether they are framed as personal issues or public issues, specially the economic downturn.

97
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:43,056
>> Fascinating.

98
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:45,037
Is it Nana who’s next?

99
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:47,017
>> I’m Nana.

100
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:49,027
I’m from Georgia.

101
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:53,017
It’s Caucasus not Georgia in USA.

102
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,009
>> [laugh].

103
00:07:54,009 --> 00:08:03,099
>> I am working as a representative of Israeli delegation here in Georgia and Ukraine and in Belarus.

104
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:08,070
Also I have a travel company with my friend.

105
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:17,022
We’re dealing with the incoming tourists and for me the most I pay attention

106
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:22,065
on the sociological imagination in the chapter one,:

107
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:29,073
it was quite interesting for me how people can imagine the scenes in the world,

108
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:37,083
and also marriage and divorce, because in Georgia it’s quite complicated.

109
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,022
>> Thank you, Nana.

110
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:42,062
And then finally.

111
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:48,017
>> Hello, my name is Pavel [inaudible] University School of [inaudible]

112
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:54,004
and National Relations which is the case in Southwestern Russia.

113
00:08:54,004 --> 00:09:00,090
I found this article very interesting because it’s referring to the effect

114
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:11,097
that our lives are just a moment in terms of historical change and even the…

115
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:18,078
so we have to think more, to think wider in this case.

116
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:22,033
>> That’s very interesting.

117
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:26,032
Okay, well, these are some very interesting ways of beginning our thinking

118
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:30,078
about what Mills was trying to say and what I’d like to do now with you guys is

119
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,082
to try to go through the essay in a little bit of detail —

120
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:40,096
from Kathmandu, to Siberia, to Georgia, to Spanish Harlem, to Philadelphia —

121
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:46,060
and talk about the meaning of some of these lines and how we should interpret them.

122
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,053
I want to begin with the first paragraph, the second line where Mills says,

123
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:56,084
“they sensed that within their everyday world, they cannot overcome their troubles

124
00:09:56,084 --> 00:10:02,018
and this feel, and this feeling they are quite often correct.”

125
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,088
One question that I want to ask you is this, is,

126
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:13,020
is there some sense in which that line and the essay as a whole gives an impression to people

127
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:22,069
that if only they can develop a sociological imagination, that they can overcome their troubles.

128
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:26,012
And is that really realistic?

129
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:36,004
What are some of the dilemmas involved in thinking about this in such a way?

130
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,083
>> Yeah. I believe that was something that had

131
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,091
something to do a little bit more with this psychology of it, you know,

132
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:47,010
somebody kinda trapped in their own sometimes made-up shell.

133
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,068
It’s because they feel — I mean it’s almost like looking at this minute, you know, I was never able…

134
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:57,015
I wasn’t much of a person that was very smart coming out of high school, I guess,

135
00:10:57,015 --> 00:11:01,003
so I didn’t take the college route.

136
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:06,079
And as I got older, I wanted to go to college but now this is a forwarding opportunity.

137
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,065
I feel like I’m widening now a little bit like from personal experience .

138
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:12,049
So that’s kinda like the way I look at it — like

139
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:18,035
instead of me sentencing that within my own shell, now I feel like I’m just through this course.

140
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:21,069
I’m feeling like I’m kind of getting over it.

141
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:26,077
>> And, is there a sense though — I’m curious to know — in which…

142
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:31,069
Does having a sociological imagination give us any legitimate reason to believe

143
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:36,086
that we are in a better position to overcome our personal troubles?

144
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:45,092
Or is that an unrealistic kind of thing to begin the essay with?

145
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:54,039
>> I didn’t personally interpret it as such. Instead I interpreted this repeated notion

146
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:00,027
of not being able to overcome one’s personal troubles —

147
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:08,078
I interpreted that as Mills arguing for a larger perspective, not necessarily saying

148
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:15,030
that having a sociological imagination will allow you to overcome troubles

149
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:25,022
but instead emphasizing that our troubles are not strictly derived from the individual.

150
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:33,043
So Mills is arguing that having that sociological imagination will give you a different perspective on your troubles

151
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,087
but it will not necessarily solve your troubles.

152
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:42,073
>> Very interesting. Would anyone else like to comment on this?

153
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:51,050
>> I think almost the same because I, I think it’s not depend to overcome the troubles,

154
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,057
it’s not coming from the sociological imagination.

155
00:12:56,057 --> 00:13:07,005
You can you can solve your troubles and solve your problems without knowing it but it helps you quite a lot.

156
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:09,078
>> But are you sure about that, Nana?

157
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:17,002
Are you really sure that having a sociological imagination would help you in solving the personal troubles?

158
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:20,005
>> Eh. Like in Georgia [inaudible].

159
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:23,094
>> Oh, really? Could you say more about that?

160
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:31,035
>> Let’s say, in Georgia if you’re…

161
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:40,060
like, for people who are coming from abroad, it’s not easy to find some jobs.

162
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,020
If you are not an investor it’s not easy to find it.

163
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:50,079
If you know the sociological imagination, like to help

164
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,091
how people think about it, you will not come in Georgia and start your work here.

165
00:13:56,091 --> 00:14:00,075
You will go to another country to find some job.

166
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:03,084
Let’s say, let’s say this example.

167
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:06,031
>> So, in other words, having the socio… that’s a really good answer.

168
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:12,072
Having the sociological imagination is going to perhaps one way of having a sociological imagination

169
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:17,075
is to know our probabilities, and understanding the probabilities means

170
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:23,037
that we can assess our chances and decide what we should try and what we shouldn’t try, right?

171
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:25,052
>> Yeah.

172
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:27,078
>> Okay. But let me ask you a question, Estela.

173
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:32,009
You’re a Princeton student, okay?

174
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,075
>> If you knew (>> Mhm.) the probabilities when you applied to Princeton of being accepted,

175
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:39,076
would you have ever tried?

176
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:47,074
>> I mean, I think I kind of did know the probabilities was less than ten percent acceptance rate.

177
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:55,069
And over, I think it’s, it was about 30,000 people who applied my year,

178
00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:04,045
with only… with less than 2,000 of us being accepted, the probability was extremely low.

179
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:11,053
But you have to, in the case of applying to Princeton University,

180
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:19,004
I think there was something worth a lot more than… I think it was worth taking my chances.

181
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:24,042
>> But the thing is just: did having a sociological imagination and knowing the odds,

182
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:27,099
did that increase the chances of you applying? Or don’t you think

183
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:33,082
that there are some people who are having that knowledge might have said, “It’s not worth it to try at all”?

184
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:38,048
I mean, if somebody finds out that the chances of doing,

185
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:44,016
of succeeding in any field are small, does that knowledge necessarily help them in the end?

186
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:49,004
We’re assuming that it’s empowering to have that knowledge,

187
00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:53,094
but I wonder if it could also be disempowering.

188
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:56,037
What do you… (>> I think it could…) Go ahead.

189
00:15:56,037 --> 00:16:04,039
>> it could certainly be discouraging, especially if you consider Mills’ article in general,

190
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:12,010
he’s kind of taking away from the notion of individual agency and individual power.

191
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:22,054
So when you take that away, it does and can seem very discouraging.

192
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:25,061
>> Doug, what do you think about this?

193
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:30,007
>> Well, basically I think that Estela hit the nail right on the head.

194
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:34,067
That — you know — that sense of, you know, when like things are hopeless,

195
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:38,006
people are going to say, “Why am I going to put the effort in?”

196
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:44,061
But, if you realize, like Estela did, that you know, that doesn’t just define who you are,

197
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:48,065
that, you know, that 10%, if you’re going to part of that 10%,

198
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:51,000
you’re part of that ten percent like what are you going to do about it?

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,088
It is what it is, and that really, I think that could really be freeing for somebody

200
00:16:55,088 --> 00:17:00,008
because that’s not going to really upset them if they turn around and get rejected.

201
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:04,006
They’ll say, okay, whatever, you know, although I was ready for that.

202
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:08,072
It’s kinda like a you know, “expect the”… “expect the worst,”

203
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:12,000
or “hope for the best and expect the worst” kind of thing, I guess.

204
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,027
And I don’t know if I am missing that point.

205
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:19,019
>> Let’s move on to the next part of the paper.

206
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:25,057
At the very beginning of the second paragraph, Mills says, “Underlying this sense of being trapped

207
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:31,077
are seemingly impersonal changes in the very structure of continent wide societies.”

208
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:36,070
There were some discussion on the discussion boards

209
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,011
over the last few days about what Mills meant by impersonal changes.

210
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:44,099
And I thought that you guys did a very good job

211
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,043
of clarifying the issue for those who were confused, but what does this mean to you?

212
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:52,032
What are some of the kinds of impersonal changes

213
00:17:52,032 --> 00:18:00,041
that affect you in the society in which you live as a way of conceiving of what Mills is talking about?

214
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,038
Dipendra, could you start?

215
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:09,015
>> I was very much interested in the previous paragraph

216
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:12,035
so I was about to speak but I lost my connection.

217
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:17,068
So, maybe I would rather go back to that paragraph and I’ll jump to this paragraph at the end.

218
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:22,059
>> Sure, why don’t you do that. (>> So, in the previous thing.) Go ahead, please do.

219
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:27,077
>> So, I have a different I have a, I have a different perspective on

220
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:36,044
that it does say, it is said that within the everyday works they cannot overcome the troubles.

221
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:39,070
I want to keep myself in this example.

222
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,037
I have my parents divorced.

223
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:51,025
So in this actually when my parents, then was suddenly, the problem that I’m facing in the world.

224
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:55,093
So, I, believe is facing this kind of problem and I was so… I have a small sister

225
00:18:55,093 --> 00:19:01,066
and I have my mom crying in front of me every day and my dad was with another woman.

226
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:09,005
So, how I felt, it was like I felt that this was only me. This is only “I’m the guy” problem.

227
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:14,084
But sociological imagination, I think that in a broader perspective,

228
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:25,025
when I look at my society then I see a lot of people who get who get divorced so then, then I do is,

229
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:33,026
I simply hiding myself and say that, okay boy, this is, this is not only the way you move ahead.

230
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:39,001
It’s not, spend your whole life regretting because your dad married to another woman or something.

231
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:46,055
So, when I look at only… when I think that is my problem only, I feel I’m trapped in that problem.

232
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:53,044
But when I come out of my family, when I come out, when I look at my society then I feel a lot,

233
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:59,046
this is the broader perspective that I should look into and that really motivated me.

234
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:04,018
>> Well, I think that, that is a really wonderful statement because what you’re saying

235
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:11,053
is that you feel as though the understanding that your experience was not a personal problem

236
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:18,055
but was part of a larger trend and a larger public issue inspired you to feel empowered.

237
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:22,076
And that you decided that you are going to rise above your social circumstances

238
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:26,005
with that knowledge knowing that was not your fault

239
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:30,049
or knowing that this was not the fault of your family —

240
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:36,028
and I actually, I think that’s a really excellent response to my concern

241
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:40,071
and it’s really a nice response because I think that in the case of divorce,

242
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:46,028
it’s true that many children feel as though they are themselves the cause of their parents’ divorce

243
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:50,021
so they feel as though they are responsible for it and certainly it’s true

244
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:56,009
that their family members blame themselves, and I think it is the case that

245
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:02,005
if you know that you’re part of something larger and wider, perhaps that is actually empowering

246
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:06,001
to be able to get beyond it and move beyond it.

247
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:13,046
And yet I must tell you that I feel still nevertheless a certain concern over these lines

248
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:20,074
and what they imply in the essay because for many people, you know, their lives are just really hard.

249
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:28,020
And, it is going to be hard for them whether they know that they’re part of a larger social trend or not.

250
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,050
And the ability to rise beyond their social circumstances,

251
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:40,015
I worry, takes a lot more obviously than any kind of knowledge or understanding of this kind,

252
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:53,056
but perhaps that’s just obvious and not worth being overly concerned with.

253
00:21:53,056 --> 00:22:01,004
By the way, in our Princeton Seminars, there are moments, as Estela will tell you, of complete silence.

254
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:04,045
And I encourage those moments in my seminar. I believe in silence.

255
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:07,080
I think it’s great for people to be able to sit and think for a second.

256
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,039
Sometimes we’ll have silence for 30 seconds in the room before somebody talks.

257
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,050
We shouldn’t always feel pressured to fill in every gap at every moment,

258
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:25,033
and no more so just because we happen to be on the Internet for 30,000 other students right now.

259
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:30,071
Does anybody else have anything they wanted to add to that before we move on there, then?

260
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:34,097
>> Yes. May I add something? It will be kind of question.

261
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:40,058
When you were talking in your lecture about sociological imagination,

262
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:46,000
what we find was mortgage and divorce — situations and issues.

263
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:55,053
I remember the words of Soviet secretary-general Joseph Stalin ’cause he once said to Averill Harriman.

264
00:22:55,053 --> 00:23:01,085
He said, “The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of million is statistic.”

265
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:08,059
I’d like to know that I am not a fan of Joseph Stalin, and my opinion, he was a dictator.

266
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:12,034
That was just the first thing that came to my mind,

267
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:17,047
whether there is an argument, whether he said it or not.

268
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:24,042
So I wanted to ask a bit political question.

269
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:32,008
I understand that in terms of historical change, as also Mills noted,

270
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:42,014
our lives are only a moment so today anything around us could be revealed as a statistic —

271
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:48,033
even our lives can be a statistic within this scope

272
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:56,017
of the population size, and then the scope of many other issues.

273
00:23:56,017 --> 00:24:01,024
So our president tells about wages.

274
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:07,018
When he tells about wages, he cites average wages data.

275
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:13,020
Why doesn’t he cite the lowest [inaudible], for example Tatiana

276
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:25,036
who is which a school teacher in Siberia in who has four children and tries to survive with four kids.

277
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:31,078
How do you think, professor? Can the government treat its people just as a statistic?

278
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:38,094
And where is the border of statistic and the real life?

279
00:24:38,094 --> 00:24:43,006
>> Well, I think that it’s very tempting to use a single statistic,

280
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:48,069
and of course what a sociological imagination is going to do,

281
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:52,097
is going to try to encourage people to look at the variation,

282
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:57,071
and to try to explain the variation in a society.

283
00:24:57,071 --> 00:25:04,040
And, I think that there’s always a tendency to try to put the focus in one place or the other

284
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,040
but your job is as a sociologist is to move toward an understanding and grasping

285
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,090
of that variation in which you just did in your wonderful comment

286
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:22,043
and that’s a great quote which I’m sure that I’ll be using in the future when I give this lecture again.

287
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:27,030
I want to ask you guys to take a peek though at the notion of

288
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:34,042
that first line in the essay, and I want to get back to this issue of impersonal changes.

289
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:40,053
Could you guys try to think about what that means,

290
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:47,038
and try to help the students who were concerned about that all on the website to reflect on that a little bit more?

291
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,087
What are some of the impersonal changes in your society?

292
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:55,017
Nana has gone off, why don’t we go to Doug?

293
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:59,049
>> When I look at this line, as far as impersonal changes,

294
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:02,043
I felt like that was something that, you know,

295
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:07,069
in a time, I mean, it was brought up before about what’s going on with the housing crisis,

296
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:10,005
with the job crisis and everything else.

297
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:14,037
And in a time when jobs are, you know, so few and far between,

298
00:26:14,037 --> 00:26:19,037
somebody can very easily think of themselves “Well there’s something wrong with me that’s why I’m not working,”

299
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:24,002
when, if they look at the, you know, the way that everything is in society,

300
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:26,097
it’s not a personal change that you need to make,

301
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:29,089
it’s the way that the society is that, you know, the…

302
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:34,098
the structure and, as it goes, the very structure of the continent-wide society

303
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:39,011
that if there’s, there’s change made to the system,

304
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:42,025
not something that has to do with this one person —

305
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:46,006
like I feel like that line is trying to give somebody a little bit of hope you know,

306
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:49,009
like “Look, it’s not you! You have the ability, you just need to understand

307
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,012
that there’s a problem out there right now.” I think we’re just going

308
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:57,004
to need to try a little bit harder and don’t let yourself down and don’t feel like you’re trapped.

309
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:59,053
>> Okay. Estela?

310
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:06,025
>> No, I think he saw that very well.

311
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,095
I’m trying to think.

312
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:16,036
I’m looking at what he says the structure of continent-wide societies and just contextualizing this

313
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:24,041
in nineteen…, I mean, if we consider the effect of the Internet now in our very discussion here today,

314
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:31,023
where we were discussing this with people on various continents, various countries.

315
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:44,026
So looking at impersonal changes, that’s something far beyond our what he says as personal troubles,…

316
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:51,020
>> Yeah. I think that one of the things that concerns me about this point as well is that, you know,

317
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:58,019
the emphasis on, obviously, the impersonal changes and that as if they are always trapping us.

318
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:03,082
And I think that we have to have more a nuanced view of it — at least I would propose that —

319
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:09,068
and the, you know, the impersonal change of today of the Internet

320
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:15,070
obviously is also leading to possibilities like the one that we have before us right now.

321
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,055
And, I think that our job as sociologists

322
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:23,033
is to look at the ways in which impersonal changes not only trap us,

323
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:28,024
but also liberate us and potentially make us more free.

324
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:33,081
And I wonder whether or not anybody could present an example other than the Internet

325
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:37,030
of any kind of impersonal change in their own society.

326
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:41,092
Or perhaps the internet is the best one for your society right now that you’d like to refer to,

327
00:28:41,092 --> 00:29:13,002
but in which the actual impersonal change has been liberating rather than simply constraining.

328
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:17,055
Remember silence is fine. Silence is good in the seminar.

329
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:22,086
Everyone can think.

330
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:31,088
>> I think that was a good example, try to recover other issues.

331
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:37,014
>> Okay. Well maybe we can ask our online viewers,

332
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:42,083
the other members of the class, to think about that issue a little bit as we move forward in the class.

333
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:48,093
I want to move on now to a discussion of the New Yorker article

334
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:55,040
that was written by the great writer, the great non-fiction writer, Malcolm Gladwell.

335
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,006
And I saw some questions on the discussion boards

336
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:05,054
about why I would have assigned this article for the first class.

337
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:10,076
And in fact, the article was assigned

338
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:15,075
for exactly the reason that many of you proposed in your answers to the person who asked that question:

339
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:20,073
because I believe it exemplifies the sociological imagination.

340
00:30:20,073 --> 00:30:24,002
Can you guys hear me right now?

341
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:26,089
Yes? Okay, good.

342
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:32,053
So, let’s begin now by talking a little bit about Gladwell’s article.

343
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:35,068
Gladwell being a Canadian who came to the United States

344
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:39,064
and was kind of intrigued by the culture of New York City

345
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:44,042
in which he found that there were many people who were obsessed with Harvard in particular,

346
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:49,046
and who seemed to think that if they had gone there

347
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:56,008
that there was nothing of greater importance that could have happened to them in their lives.

348
00:30:56,008 --> 00:31:00,006
And he wrote this essay based on, as we know,

349
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:04,045
based on the research of sociologist Jerome Karabel largely,

350
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:15,040
about the nature of admissions at Harvard, Princeton and Yale,

351
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,033
and the way in which it moved in the direction that it is in today.

352
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:26,010
And, one of the things that I found very interesting about the responses on the Internet to this

353
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,078
was that, there were many people who saw the decision

354
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:37,075
of the Ivy League Schools to look at the “whole person” rather than a single dimension

355
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:43,033
as meaning — as implying — that, that was somehow a false promise,

356
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:47,066
or that people have been excluded

357
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:53,097
that people, that they themselves were being promised something that wasn’t really fair or obtainable

358
00:31:53,097 --> 00:32:01,035
when they were given the hope that they one day could achieve or go to an Ivy League School.

359
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:07,021
And I’m just curious about that response because my own feeling about it in looking at the way

360
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:10,062
that the system of college admissions emerged is that,

361
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:15,022
while I think it’s good that the largest group of students in the university

362
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:18,036
has gotten there because of their academic achievement,

363
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:23,042
I think that it is also true that there are so many other qualities in life

364
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:27,020
that make for a deserving and an interesting human being.

365
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:33,060
And, would we really want a college to only include the people who have the highest scores

366
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,096
rather than a system like the one  that has been designed

367
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:42,096
which actually looks at a much wider variety of personal characteristics?

368
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:47,042
And I’m just curious about what your response was to some of those comments

369
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:53,065
and how you would design a system like this if it was up to you.

370
00:32:53,065 --> 00:32:55,046
Dipendra.

371
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:59,032
>> Actually when I was going through this text,

372
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:03,006
what I’ve felt was the education system the admission system

373
00:33:03,006 --> 00:33:09,047
that was there and unfortunately, in Nepal, I’ve been practicing that now.

374
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:13,064
So, we have the, actually a brief background of

375
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:19,048
the admission system that we have here and then I’ll get back to my point.

376
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:26,016
So, here at Nepal, what [we have] there are typically two different kinds of colleges or universities.

377
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:32,094
The primary targets of all the university and all the college here in Nepal is you should get at least good marks —

378
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:37,096
at least, [inaudible] more than 60 percent or more than three GPA —

379
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:41,011
so that you can get into good college or something like that.

380
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:47,012
And very few, very few colleges and universities — we count in hands or fingers —

381
00:33:47,012 --> 00:33:53,074
that they’ll look overall student or they look at overall characteristics of students.

382
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:59,014
So it would depend, but I would like to say seeing, to look at examples

383
00:33:59,014 --> 00:34:05,004
that I have seen here in Nepal, what I have come to conclude is typically,

384
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:09,099
there are two different university here that I would like to mention in Nepal.

385
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:15,022
The Tribhuvan University which is government owned university and Kathmandu University

386
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:17,054
that is privately owned university.

387
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:20,016
So, why does Tribhuvan University does it?

388
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:24,065
They don’t have a proper definite system of taking in students.

389
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:28,073
So, every time they can have a ticket of admission in that college.

390
00:34:28,073 --> 00:34:35,037
They have let’s say you have crossed 50 percent then you’ll get into that university — and where I am now.

391
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:41,045
And before coming to this university, I actually dropped the Kathmandu University

392
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:46,044
because private university and which required rigorous competition.

393
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:50,096
They had added a baseline for academics.

394
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:55,046
We need to get at least 60 percent in your high school, then

395
00:34:55,046 --> 00:34:59,058
you should be astounding in extra curricular activities,

396
00:34:59,058 --> 00:35:04,073
you should be astounding in sports, you should be social, and so many characteristics.

397
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:11,085
And where the products that come out after from the universities after four years,

398
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:15,023
we can see a clear distinction here in Nepal:

399
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:22,081
Kathmandu University, which has a system of looking a student from all dimension,

400
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:29,052
the students are… they are very practical, they know a lot of things, you know, they are outgoing.

401
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:33,048
And while we look at the students of Tribhuvan University,

402
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:38,076
what I see is students are very much confined to books —

403
00:35:38,076 --> 00:35:45,081
not even in textbooks: we have these papers here that means the questions that, the exams.

404
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:53,036
So there are some predicted questions and you go through that question and you will get questions out of that.

405
00:35:53,036 --> 00:36:02,050
It is sometimes… that’s really a very difficult task at Tribhuvan University.

406
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:10,059
So, what I feel is, for a college student to get admission, academics should be one of the primary criteria,

407
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:14,021
but we should have also look at the students in overall —

408
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:18,031
how good they [inaudible] in society, how good they [inaudible] in sports.

409
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:19,085
That’s what I [think].
>> Thank you.

410
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:23,001
Thank you for that interesting comment, Dipendra.

411
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:25,004
Would anyone else like to comment on this?

412
00:36:25,004 --> 00:36:27,021
>> Yes, may I comment?
>> Yes.

413
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:30,042
>> Because getting in is a very pressing problem for me.

414
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:39,011
Now I’m graduating in a few days, and then I’ll be… I have to find an advocate’s masters program.

415
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:46,048
And while I was reading “Getting In” article, I have a feeling you know,

416
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:56,059
well, the situation that existed in the beginning of the twentieth Century in Harvard University and Yale etc.

417
00:36:56,059 --> 00:37:02,017
With standardized tests now exists in Russia,

418
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:07,038
in the twenty-first century, in the beginning of the twenty-first century.

419
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:18,078
So, I think it’s not a good way to admit students just on the basis of standardized tests.

420
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:28,039
Academic records is a very is a very… is an important problem

421
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:35,032
but while admitting they should see…

422
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:45,081
they should see the person[’s] hope — hope as in hope —, his background, his experience,

423
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:56,035
what he can do, maybe… just not only his studies.

424
00:37:56,035 --> 00:38:01,068
>> So, it’s interesting to hear your perspectives on this, and it is true that outside the United States,

425
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:06,065
that the standards are usually much more narrow for admissions decisions.

426
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:12,051
And I think that, that is what accounted for some of the surprise

427
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:18,058
that initially came on to the site about the way that it’s done here in the United States.

428
00:38:18,058 --> 00:38:22,074
I want to, oh, I see we have another person that just joined us.

429
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:25,075
Another Princeton student named Dixon Lee.

430
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:27,013
Hi, Dixon.

431
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,028
>> Hi, Mitch.

432
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:32,082
>> So, we’re talking right now about the Malcolm Gladwell essay

433
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:39,011
and one of the interesting points that I want to sort of end by thinking about,

434
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:43,007
is something that came up a lot on the discussion boards

435
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:47,051
which was the study that was cited — and this is for everybody, not just for Dixon —

436
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:56,070
the study that was cited by Gladwell, by my colleague Alan Krueger, who did a study of the people

437
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:01,034
who were — let’s say “hypothetically,” as it’s described in the article —

438
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:09,039
accepted into a state university like Penn State, at a private university like the University of Pennsylvania.

439
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,088
And what was his point in making that comparison and what did he find?

440
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:17,037
Does anybody remember?

441
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:22,052
It certainly elicited a lot of response on the discussion boards.

442
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:28,010
>> Um. So they referred to it as comparing apples to apples.

443
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:37,062
And what they discovered is that both the person who decides to go to the more elite university —

444
00:39:37,062 --> 00:39:45,051
“elites” — and the person who decides to go to the state school, both do well in the future.

445
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:53,068
With the finding of one exception, which is those from the lowest economic strata.

446
00:39:53,068 --> 00:40:01,000
Those from this strata were seen as benefiting from the elite’s education.

447
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,088
And it didn’t say… it didn’t explain this in any way but that was the finding.

448
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:13,062
>> Can anybody explain — thank you Estela — Can anybody explain to us what was the logic of the article?

449
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:18,095
He used the words “selection” and “treatment”, and what was the exact way

450
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:28,024
in which he went about in doing his study, in which those words became so important?

451
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:30,090
What was he measuring? What was he comparing?

452
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:36,020
Does anybody have any memory of that aspect of the article?

453
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:42,057
What was Krueger doing there?

454
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:46,016
In the traditional — it’s just to jog your memory —

455
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:51,078
in the traditional measures of the impact of an Ivy League education,

456
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:56,017
comparisons have been made between the salaries of people

457
00:40:56,017 --> 00:41:01,026
who graduated from Ivy League Schools and the salaries of people

458
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:08,033
who graduated from other schools, and what Kruger said was, “Let’s change the comparison.”

459
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:16,023
Instead of comparing it in that way, how did we do it?

460
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:22,029
He compared the people who were the same person.

461
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:25,067
He only took people who were graduated, who were admitted

462
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:28,086
both to private schools — to Ivy League Schools — and to other schools

463
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:32,004
and who chose, for some reason, to go to the other school instead.

464
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:38,054
And he compared those same people against the average people who came out of Ivy League Schools

465
00:41:38,054 --> 00:41:44,076
and he found out that those people actually did just as well as the people who went to Ivy League Schools.

466
00:41:44,076 --> 00:41:49,002
And so his point was, that it was not necessarily the treatment

467
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:53,090
of going to an Ivy League School that mattered — in terms of the success of people —

468
00:41:53,090 --> 00:42:01,061
but it was instead the selection into the system from the very beginning

469
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:05,093
of certain kinds of people that were destined to be successful.

470
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:10,065
And he basically, despite the fact that he’s a Princeton professor

471
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:14,056
and has every reason to be biased in favor of the Ivy League,

472
00:42:14,056 --> 00:42:20,017
he concluded that the impact of the Ivy League is not nearly as great

473
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:24,041
as it’s taken to be by the wider society and the wider world.

474
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,041
Now it seems to me that that kind of analysis that Krueger did,

475
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:32,028
is in the best tradition of the sociological imagination.

476
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:37,079
And it seems to me that, that kind of information should be empowering to many people,

477
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:46,010
regardless of whether or not they would even want to come to Princeton or some other Ivy League School.

478
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,072
Did you guys… did that information make a similar impression on you guys?

479
00:42:50,072 --> 00:42:58,024
What effect did it have on you to read that part of the article?

480
00:42:58,024 --> 00:43:02,060
>> Yeah, I understood. Yeah, I understand what you’re saying.

481
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:08,096
The one quote that he has here is “having Penn on your resume opens doors.”

482
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:15,068
And I do notice that there is that sort of the meanest attitude when it comes to society in general.

483
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:20,025
People turn and maybe look at certain people a certain kind of way — they put them up on a pedestal —

484
00:43:20,025 --> 00:43:24,056
and you know, it can sometimes be a little unfortunate that they would do something like that

485
00:43:24,056 --> 00:43:28,036
but you know, I understand; and

486
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:34,072
because there’s such an emphasis that’s been put on for so long about who’s coming out of where —

487
00:43:34,073 --> 00:43:38,024
just, you know, how, also like what he said earlier in the article,

488
00:43:38,024 --> 00:43:41,075
you know, when he… when somebody said they were from Harvard it was like everybody

489
00:43:41,075 --> 00:43:44,094
in the room got quiet you know and they were like, “Oh, this guy is from Harvard!”

490
00:43:44,094 --> 00:43:49,096
Just like I understand that’s what he was explaining.

491
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:55,078
And it kind of seems to me like — I’m not sure if I got [it] right,

492
00:43:55,078 --> 00:43:59,094
but what he was saying was that some of the [students]

493
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:06,048
well, did really well in the lower-tiered school — like the state school — that they only did

494
00:44:06,048 --> 00:44:10,077
as good as the people who were like average students in the Ivy League School.

495
00:44:10,077 --> 00:44:13,090
>> No, no, no, no, no, no. It was exactly the opposite of that.

496
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:18,084
He is basically saying that if you took the same person who is admitted to both,

497
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:24,091
then it’s really ultimately the individual who mattered more than (>> Okay.) the social context.

498
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:29,069
>> Okay, so, yes. I, I just, I understood that what he was talking about with that, you know,

499
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:36,005
having Penn on your resume, that’s basically, you know, the whole, the general thing basically.

500
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:37,079
Your dream is what you’re looking at.

501
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,004
You know, when you’re coming out of that school, you’re grand and people look at

502
00:44:41,004 --> 00:44:46,001
that and they think that when you’re coming out of Penn or Harvard, you’re like a Mercedes.

503
00:44:46,001 --> 00:44:49,013
>> Right. But his… >> When you’re coming out of Penn State,…

504
00:44:49,013 --> 00:44:52,016
>> But his point though is — and it’s important to clarify this

505
00:44:52,016 --> 00:44:55,016
and make sure that we get on the same page on this point —

506
00:44:55,016 --> 00:45:00,057
is that his point is that when you look at the statistical data for large numbers of people,

507
00:45:00,057 --> 00:45:07,013
then those anecdotal stories actually don’t have as much explanatory value

508
00:45:07,013 --> 00:45:13,019
as the analysis that he did would have.

509
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:15,047
Dixon, what do you think about this?

510
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:20,021
>> So, when I was reading over it, I was interested to see that he says that

511
00:45:20,021 --> 00:45:25,027
the person who is accepted to Penn and the person who’s accepted to Penn State would do the same thing

512
00:45:25,027 --> 00:45:32,064
but then I was wondering, so admissions factors don’t always account for everything that person is capable of.

513
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:38,032
So, I think it might have been just outside of the scope for his project.

514
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:45,033
But I think that I would have been interested at this project have continued and then look at —

515
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:51,020
so — what are the things that the [inaudible] students for and how did those affect people in the upper strata

516
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,001
that normally wouldn’t be affected by the treatment

517
00:45:56,001 --> 00:46:03,076
that Princeton gives the, like the, really lower, lower strata that [inaudible] was talking about earlier.

518
00:46:03,076 --> 00:46:06,030
>> Good. That’s very interesting.

519
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,007
So, basically, I hope that we can use Alan Krueger’s study

520
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:13,086
as a way of getting and thinking more about the questions that I raised

521
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:19,027
at the end of the first lecture of how it is that the individual makes a difference.

522
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:26,016
And the extent to which we are truly trapped by certain social circumstances.

523
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:31,065
Sometimes, we imagine that the social circumstances that are surrounding us

524
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:39,009
are trapping us in ways that they actually are not, and it takes constant sociological investigation

525
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:45,034
to know the difference between a real trap and an illusion of one.

526
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:53,049
So, I want to end today’s discussion by just saying a little bit about where we’re going next.

527
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:57,090
I want to say, first of all, that this was an experiment today.

528
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:01,062
I know that the discussion was by no means perfect

529
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:06,055
although it was as good as I could have ever hoped from a group of students around the world

530
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:15,032
and I thought that your comments in the seminar today were really great and interesting and a wonderful beginning.

531
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:22,010
But technically it could be improved and we will certainly work on that in the weeks to come.

532
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,060
I really appreciate the patience of everybody who’s watching

533
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,064
as well as your interest and I appreciate your support

534
00:47:29,064 --> 00:47:33,019
and your understanding that we are part now of a really big experiment.

535
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:37,092
We’re trying to do something new and I suspect that we’re going to learn a lot along the way.

536
00:47:37,092 --> 00:47:41,088
When we meet the next time in the online forum,

537
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:46,053
we’re going to include some new people that were not here today; we’ll also have some familiar faces.

538
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:53,002
We’ll try to substitute some new people in, to keep the conversation representing different parts of the world.

539
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:57,019
And, we will try to do some things to improve it each time

540
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:02,097
until we really get it to a point where it is something that is working really well and we are really happy with it.

541
00:48:02,097 --> 00:48:07,063
But I must say that for a first time today, for a first effort, I’m really pleased with this.

542
00:48:07,063 --> 00:48:13,020
I also, I wanted to say that I was really excited to see the large number of study groups

543
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:21,027
that had formed from around the world and I wanted to also give a special welcome to the people

544
00:48:21,027 --> 00:48:27,079
that are clearly participating in the class from Iran and from Afghanistan —

545
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:35,063
two countries which do not have the greatest relationship officially with the United States today

546
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:43,094
but that is certainly not due to any ill feeling on the part of Americans

547
00:48:43,094 --> 00:48:50,048
and we certainly all believe that these kinds of contacts are the ones that we should be having

548
00:48:50,048 --> 00:48:53,053
and I hope that in our future online seminars

549
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:59,009
that we can have representatives from Iran and from Afghanistan with us as well.

550
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:02,024
So, I ’m going to say goodbye to you all now.

551
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:06,073
So, thank all of you online for participating in this wonderful experiment

552
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:12,005
and I look forward to seeing you this Monday with the second lecture,

553
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:16,007
in the discussion boards which I will be monitoring very carefully,

554
00:49:16,007 --> 00:49:26,000
and of course, in our second online seminar next Wednesday.
