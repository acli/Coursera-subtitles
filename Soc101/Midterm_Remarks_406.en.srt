00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:05,055
I wanted to take this opportunity to say something to all of your about the midterm —

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,014
both to those of you who took the exam

3
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:11,001
and to those of you who did not.

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,088
Let me begin by congratulating all of the folks

5
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:16,092
who were able to sit down and do it.

6
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:22,090
I know that for many of you, this was the first time in many years that you have taken an exam.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,050
It was a stressful thing to find the time to prepare

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,087
and then to go through the rigours of a three-hour closed-book exam

9
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:34,034
in which you consulted no notes.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,028
But now that you have done it, you can see that you have what it takes

11
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:45,083
to formulate your thoughts on sociological themes and concepts and theories in a coherent way.

12
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:51,014
Now we are about to begin a new process, called “peer assessment,”

13
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:57,024
in which you will be asked to evaluate up to five exams from your fellow students.

14
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:01,029
You’ll be using a rubric that we’ve designed here at Princeton.

15
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:07,012
You should know that this rubric is not only based on my initial opinion about the correct answers,

16
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:11,039
but also upon our analysis of a large number of exams

17
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,068
that were turned in over the past few days.

18
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:19,091
Sometimes, I noticed that you guys did not get the answer that I had expected,

19
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:24,011
but that you wrote something else that showed an understanding of the material.

20
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:29,005
For those students who did not receive many points for the answers I had stipulated,

21
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:33,076
I have added the possibility that you can get a certain number of make-up points.

22
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:40,026
These make-up points are based on additional correct answers that emerged from your responses.

23
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:43,038
As you go through the process of peer assessment,

24
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:49,046
there is the possibility that you will suddenly feel discouraged by what you wrote —

25
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:53,073
the sudden recognition that your exam is not as strong as it could have been

26
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:57,074
can lead many people to think that they are not good enough.

27
00:01:57,074 --> 00:02:03,093
Anyone who comes to that conclusion would be making a big mistake at this early stage.

28
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:07,081
I want you to focus not on the score that you get —

29
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:12,034
or that you <i>think</i> you will get — on this or that question,

30
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:17,093
but on using this experience of peer assessment to learn the material.

31
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:21,054
After the process is over, I will talk to you again

32
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:25,078
about how to think about these results in a constructive way.

33
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:31,076
Just remember one thing: Our focus here is on enhancing learning.

34
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:36,011
If you keep a positive focus and don’t let yourself get discouraged,

35
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:39,049
my prediction is that you will learn the material

36
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:44,047
and, by the final, you will also become a much better test taker.

37
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:49,061
I also want to say something to people who did <i>not</i> take the midterm.

38
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:52,072
There are many ways of getting something out of this class.

39
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,038
And even if you did not take the exam,

40
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:58,041
I know from your participation in the forums

41
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,092
that you too are learning a great deal.

42
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:06,022
Although you cannot officially complete the class without taking the midterm,

43
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:10,024
you are welcome to take the final and to see how you do.

44
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,034
To everyone in this class:

45
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:19,003
Please do not think that my respect for you is based on the various numbers that you receive on this midterm

46
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:23,027
or even whether you took the exam in the first place.

47
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:28,033
I have been enormously impressed by your ongoing participation in the course forums,

48
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:32,047
and I believe there are many ways to demonstrate to oneself and others

49
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:37,037
a more systematic understanding of the social world.

50
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:41,049
So those of you who are doing the peer assessment, get to work!

51
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,072
You will be asked to assess up to five papers before you can get your own results.

52
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:50,007
Remember, there is no online seminar this week;

53
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:53,023
we all have enough work to do with the midterm as it is.

54
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,056
I’ll see all of you again on Monday,

55
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:57,077
when we will be talking about being alone,

56
00:03:57,077 --> 00:04:02,004
being in groups, and being in networks.
